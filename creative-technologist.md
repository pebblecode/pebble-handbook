# The Creative Technologist's Handbook

pebble {code} is deliberately light on management layers. We hire talented self-starters and trust them to express themselves. This handbook is intended to be a guide to people coming into the Creative Technologist role. You might know all of this already or have a different opinion. If so please consider contributing to this handbook.

If you ever need help you should approach one of the Directors. The chances are we have already had a similar situation and if you have a juicy programming, design or product problem they will get excited about collaborating with you. 

## Challenge everything

pebble {code} gets hired to help clients uncover what they need rather than what they think they need. Regularly clients come to us with a one sentence brief and little else. 

It is our job to challenge everything they present, uncover latent requirements and to prove or disprove their assumptions.

* How do we know this is the right problem?
* Have we talked to any users about this?
* What is the business value of this idea?
* Can you prove that there is a demand for this?
* What is the revenue model?
* What does success look like?

pebble {code} believes it is not our job to make clients happy but rather to make them look good. Making a client feel uncomfortable is acceptable if it results in a successful project or even if it shows that a project is entirely misdirected. We are strong advocates of design workshops and will often ask Creative Technologists to lead these.

If you ever find yourself nodding along to client requirements you should take urgent action:

* Stand up
* Find the nearest sink
* Allow the cold water tap to run until it is really cold
* Cup your hands and fill with water
* Throw the water on your face
* Return to your seat

## Measure everything

In 'Challenge everything' it was suggested that the question 'What does success look like' should be put to a client presenting an idea. Whilst this is a useful exercise it more valuable to embed a culture of measurement in a project. This way users can inform the direction of the product and a culture of iteration can be established. Some areas that might be applicable to your project include:

* How often is a feature is used?
* How long do users take on tasks?
* How long does a key piece of functionality take to compute?
* How long does a page take to load?

By using measurement it is possible to remove subjective thinking and to give users what they really want. Furthermore measurement helps us make clients look good. If we can understand a process at the beginning of a project and measure the time on task before and after the software we make we can often identify time and cost savings. This allows the client to report around the project, look great, gain a promotion and retire young. 

## Agile

Agile is the best process for creating software products. We often find that clients have a little or no knowledge of the Agile process. It is our job to coach clients on the Agile process, to introduce the software tools we use to manage the process. Invariably we see that clients embrace the Agile process and strut round the office, parading it around their organisation like a new pair of trainers. 

We typically see five personality types around Agile. The chances are you may have come across these before if you've made any software in anger. 

### The Expert

This client gets Agile and needs no support or training. Congratulations. You have hit the jackpot. Now make something amazing.

### The Business Analyst

We see many Business Analysts transitioning into Agile development and generally we have had a great experience with this type of client. They bring strong analytical skills, the ability to deconstruct problems and generally see the value of measuring everything. They may need some coaching on the Agile process but you should be good to go.

### The Designer / Developer

This client is potentially hazardous. Where pebble is collaborating with a client team there will inevitably be issues of culture and a clash of creative control. These need addressing early in the project and ways of working should be established quickly.

If you encounter a client with Designer or Developer in their job title and they are performing the role of Product Owner establishing a good relationship early is very important. 

If you ever hear 'Can you make the logo bigger?' you should immediately step outside and vent your frustration by shouting at a line of traffic.

### The Sceptic

This client is usually in a more traditional business and is used to creating software using Waterfall. They do not understand why a 'software house' wants to talk to them every day and may think they know exactly what users want. 

This client is high risk but also high return. Most large organisations are now recognising the value of Agile so we envisage that this attitude will eventually die off. It is our job to coach on the value of Agile, and demonstrate that releasing software early and often works. 

If you can turn this client around you will likely build an extremely strong relationship, feel large amounts of enthusiasm and find an advocate. 

### The Entrepreneur

In our experience Entrepreneurs are not detail people. They have big ideas. That's their job. When it comes to the day to day of creating a project they often are not inclined to work through edge cases or create user profiles. 

Depending on the individual it may be important to have an open conversation about what the project needs to succeed. Entrepreneurs chase success and in our experience respond well to challenges and coaching. 

## Kaizen

We advocate using Kaizen at pebble {code}. Toby Hunt gave a [lightning talk on Kaizen][1] if you need a primer.

Initially the most important part of Kaizen is to establish a goal for the project. The canonical example given here is NASA where the goal given by President John F. Kennedy was "landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth" by the end of the decade. It is said that if you asked the cleaners at NASA what their job was they would parrot this goal statement.

Establishing a goal statement is also a good discipline for clients. If an idea cannot be succinctly expressed in one sentence the project may well lack direction. 

For pebble's flavour of Kaizen we are interested in measuring two values: 

* Client Ecstacy
* pebble Ecstacy 

This encapsulates what we believe is our business model. We request that Creative Technologists take responsibility for running Kaizen once a week and often find it is easiest to add onto the end of a scrum meeting. 

* Ask pebble staff to score the project out of 10 and generate a value for the team
* Ask pebble staff to suggest improvements that could be made to the project
* Reflect on any improvements made in previous Kaizen sessions
* Ask the client to score the project out of 10
* Ask the client to suggest improvement that could be made to the project
* Reflect on any improvements made in previous Kaizen sessions

You may wish to run the client and pebble staff sessions separately. We often find it is useful to keep a log of Kaizen sessions on the Trello board you are using to run the project. This way the team can visualise the improvements that are made week on week.

pebble has a Kaizen board visible to everyone in the office and we request that values are updated after Kaizen sessions. Bi-weekly we run a Kaizen session with Directors and Creative Technologists but we will often use the board for informal communication around a project.

## Recognise failure

If the ratio of failures in start-ups is 90% pebble cannot expect that every idea or project that clients brings to us will succeed. It is equally important that we challenge clients and measure everything on a project to identify a failing idea. Often this will be obvious but identifying the point at which to pivot an Agile project is something pebble needs to remain independent about. 

Letting a client know that an idea is not working and proposing alternative approaches is highly valuable to our clients and we have no qualms about identifying a failing idea.

## Celebrate success

Our teams often work for months on a single project toward an initial release or a product being pushed out to a wider audience. We are extremely proud of the creativity that happens in pebble {code} and feel strongly about celebrating team success. If you feel a team has achieved outstanding results you should feel free to suggest that the team should celebrate. Historically teams have celebrated with dinners out but you might choose as a team to do something else. Cheese tasting, a night at the movies, human foosball - it is up to you and the team. 

pebble is a collaborative company and this document is intended to evolve. As you progress through your time at pebble please contribute back to this document and make it better. 

Good luck and Godspeed. We look forward to seeing what you make!
