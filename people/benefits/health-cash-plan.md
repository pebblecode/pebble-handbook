# Health Cash Plan

We are in the process of setting up a cash plan with Simplyhealth but require more applicants so if you are interested we can see if we have enough applicants.

A cash plan is more of a preventive health care option and allows you to claim cash back on everyday health treatments such as Health Screening, Physiotherapy, Acupuncture, Dental Hygiene, Consultations and scans and many more.

All you have to do is retain your receipt when having these treatments, fill in a Simplyhealth Claim form and money will be credited back into your account within 5 days! 

Levels of cover vary according to what contributions are made and these change the Annual limits of how much cash back you can get. You can increase your premium level once a year, but you must stay at that level for a minimum of 12 months before being able to change it again.

You can also upgrade to Family cover that will include yourself, your partner and up to four children or opt to cover just yourself and your children if you prefer. 

For those of you who already have their Preferential Private Health Cover set up with Simplyhealth this Cash Plan simply runs alongside it giving you peace of mind that even more costs are covered and not only when you are in ill health.

As a guideline, here are the essential figures for a Basic Cash Back Plan.  The payback level for all benefits is 100% each year.
