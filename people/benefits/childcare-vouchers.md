# Childcare Vouchers

For you pebble Dad's and Mum's there is a choice of getting childcare vouchers from BusyBees.

These vouchers are non-taxable (up to a limit of £243 per parent, per month or £55 per parent per week) and do not attract either employee National Insurance (NI) contributions. As part of a salary sacrifice scheme each parent may save up to £933 per year! 

Childcare Vouchers can be used for all forms of registered childcare for children up to the age of 16. 

The choice of nursery, childminder etc is yours. Any appropriately registered child carer in the UK can accept Childcare Vouchers. All they will need to do is register with Busy Bees which doesn’t cost them anything, and provide their bank details so that they can receive timely payments.

If this sounds good to you, please let Francesca know to get the ball rolling!
