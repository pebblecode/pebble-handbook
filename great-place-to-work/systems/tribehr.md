**The TribeHR Performance Review Process**

You will be invited via email to complete your part of the performance review before your meeting with your line manager. The review will consist of the following: 

- **Summary** - this gives you an overview on your review completion progress
- **Kudos & Notes **- here you will find a list of Kudos & Notes received during the year
- **Skills** - to be discussed and agreed with your line manager
- **Questionnaire **- consists of a list of skills and tasks you will be reviewed on  
You will need to give feedback on your capabilities and progress for each one of them

Once all these sections have been completed, your review will be sent to your manager ready for your performance review meeting. The meeting is not only to review your performance, but also set goals for the next 6 months. 

Here is a [step-by-step guide for review time](https://sites.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/wiki/systems/tribehr-introduction-employee-notes/using-tribehr).
