# Hacking

During a hack-day, or when doing something in your 10% time, it may be appropriate to publish the output, either as code, a blog or a finished bit of software. 

A good place to start is to create a public repo on Github under the [pebble {code} organisation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpebblecode&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdEsj6n_9ZsJ34qDRJnv_cjmNFC8A). 

Unless your project is purely back-end based you will probably want to display the output of all your hard work. If you are working on a project that can be displayed as a static site then [gh-pages](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpages.github.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfB14djf6QTilEWDkK3ANkODsKbcA) is a very good option for quickly and easily hosting your project.

To use [gh-pages](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpages.github.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfB14djf6QTilEWDkK3ANkODsKbcA) simply create a branch named "gh-pages" within your repo and put all the content you want hosted in this branch. For full instructions see [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.github.com%2Fcategories%2F20%2Farticles&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzcMP98kaViy3l2_cYb5jOPNkVLTaA). For an example see [Noisy URIs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarkdurrant%2Fnoisy-uris&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfMmW-o_FXDlJDVDFdwt0wnSvmeNw) and it's [gh-pages branch](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarkdurrant%2Fnoisy-uris%2Ftree%2Fgh-pages&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzf2IB56mtTdqY2XSWqSu7kHPKbk0g).

If you want to display a .net web pages you could use [appharbor.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fappharbor.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdZLhpSwJv5gZyBtrGjvgnB_aTFDA). There is a getting started guide for App Harbor [here](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.appharbor.com%2Fkb%2Fgetting-started%2Fdeploying-your-first-application-using-git&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzesIMe82ZiWTk8RUpSkL0skRgbM7g) and addons for SQL Server, RavenDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and more [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fappharbor.com%2Faddons&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzdWBj_ETp4XFxHe9QLxDftOpukN8Q).

If you create and release a hack of any kind please let Mark know so it can be included on our playground page (_currently in development_).

Whatever you create remember to write a blog post about it, tweet about it, and generally share it with the world in any way you can think of.

**Heart Internet**

Through pebble.it, we also have access to hosting through Heart Internet. We will be setting up some FTP access for the office in time for the hack day in case it is required or useful. If no details on here by Friday 1st March, someone shout at Toby!
