# History

A short history of pebble.

pebble started in 2006 as pebble.it (founded by Toby and Seb) to offer Apple Mac support to small businesses in London. In the same year we won our first software development project, a film database, workflow and scheduling system for Al Jazeera English. For this project, and a few more, we outsourced the development. Pretty soon, we had a large amount of software development business and it became obvious that there was a better way of doing it. 

So, in early 2010, together with Alex and George, we founded pebble {code}. pebble {code}'s initial success came from financial services and gaming (Contrarius and Bede Gaming). There were a few projects before those, namely Stink, Take Five Studio and SPACE Studios - projects which are now all in maintenance mode and have been handed off to third parties so that we can concentrate on bigger and more challenging problems. Since early 2013 we have been working with AstraZeneca and looking forward to offering more innovative solutions to more Blue Chip clients.
