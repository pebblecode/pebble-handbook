# Disciplinary rules and procedures

**Introduction**

1. The rules and procedures outlined below are intended to promote fairness and consistency in the treatment of employees and will apply to all employees other than those in their probation period.  All staff should familiarise themselves with these provisions.
2. The disciplinary/dismissal rules and procedures apply equally to matters of conduct and performance. Whilst employees will not normally be dismissed for conduct or performance reasons without previous warnings, in cases of gross misconduct or in any case involving an employee who has not yet completed their probationary period, dismissal without previous warnings may be appropriate.

**Disciplinary procedures**

1. In the first instance, pebble will establish the facts surrounding the complaint and no disciplinary action will generally be taken until the matter has been investigated. This may be at one or more investigative meetings (if necessary taking into account the statements of any available witnesses). Wherever possible different people should carry out the investigation and the disciplinary hearing. It may not be necessary to resort to the formal procedure, in which case the employee’s line manager will discuss the problem with them informally, explaining clearly the nature of the problem or unsatisfactory performance, and will jointly agree with them a course of action to improve the standard of their conduct or performance.
2. However, if pebble considers that it is necessary to invoke the formal procedure, the employee will be informed. The following procedure will then apply:
    - Pebble has the right to suspend the employee on full pay to allow pebble to investigate the complaint. Suspension during investigation is not disciplinary action or a prejudgement of the issue. The period of suspension shall be for the duration of the investigation or such other period as pebble may reasonably decide.
    - Prior to a formal disciplinary hearing the employee will be informed in writing of the complaint against them. The employee will be allowed access to any relevant statements and/or papers.
    - The employee will be invited to a formal disciplinary hearing at which they will be given the opportunity to state their case and raise any relevant matter. The employee will be given reasonable time to prepare for the hearing.
    - If the employee is asked to attend a disciplinary hearing (or any meeting at which the possible termination of their employment is to be discussed), the employee has a right to be accompanied by their "chosen companion", who can be a fellow worker or a trade union official. The employee must make a written or verbal request to be accompanied. The request must be made to the Chair of the disciplinary hearing. Rights to be accompanied do not apply to investigative meetings although this facility may be extended at pebble's discretion.
    - Pebble will arrange a date for the meeting to take place. If the employee’s chosen companion cannot attend on the date proposed, he or she can offer an alternative time and date so long as it is reasonable and falls within five working days after the date proposed by pebble.
    - The employee should tell the person conducting the hearing in advance whom they have requested to act as a companion. If the employee does not wish to be accompanied this should be noted. 
    - The companion is there to act as a witness to what was said, to provide moral support and to assist and advise the employee in presenting his/her case. He or she may address the hearing (provided the employee wishes this), ask questions on behalf of the employee and confer with the employee but not answer questions on behalf of the employee. Nor may the companion prevent the employer from explaining its case. Fellow workers may not be compelled to attend as a companion.
    - The chosen companion will be able to address the hearing, put forward the employee’s case, summarise it, respond to any views expressed at the hearing and confer with them, but cannot answer questions on their behalf.
    - If the complaint is upheld, pebble will determine the disciplinary action to be taken against the employee, which will depend on the seriousness of the matter. The disciplinary actions which may be imposed by pebble are set out below.
    - The employee will be notified in writing of pebble's decision concerning the complaint and, if the complaint is upheld, the disciplinary action taken against the employee. If pebble determines that the employee must improve their performance or conduct, the employee will be provided with details of the improvements required and the date on which their performance or conduct will be assessed by pebble.
    - Pebble will notify the employee of their right to appeal the company’s decision.

3. Pebble reserves the right to implement the procedure at any stage or impose any sanction depending on the seriousness of the alleged misconduct.
4. If the employee wishes to exercise their right of appeal they must do so within five working days of receipt of pebble's written decision. The letter of appeal should indicate the full grounds upon which the appeal is made and whether it relates to the finding of guilt or the penalty imposed. If the employee elects to appeal, pebble will hold an appeal hearing at which the employee will be given the opportunity to state their grounds of appeal. The employee will be notified of the outcome of their appeal and the reasons for the decision in writing. The company’s decision with regard to the appeal will be final.
5. The employee has the right to be accompanied by their companion and the provisions set out above shall apply.
6. The employee must make all reasonable efforts to attend any disciplinary or appeal hearing. If they fail to attend without a proper excuse on more than one occasion, pebble may proceed with the hearing in their absence and draw such inferences as are appropriate from the material available and from their absence.

**Disciplinary actions**

1. Verbal warning

- In the case of a minor offence the employee will be given a formal verbal warning. The employee will be advised that the warning constitutes the first formal stage of the disciplinary procedure and that a note will be placed on their HR file. The employee will be informed of the likely consequences of further offences and, if appropriate, the nature of the improvement required from them and the period in which it is required.

2. First Written Warning

- In the case of a serious offence or a repetition of a minor offence the employee will be given a first written warning setting out the precise nature of the offence and the likely consequences of further offences. If appropriate, it will also specify the nature of the improvement required from the employee and the period in which it is required.
3. Final Written Warning

- If the employee fails to improve following a written warning or if the offence, whilst falling short of gross misconduct, is serious enough in pebble's view to warrant a final written warning, the employee will be given a final written warning. This will set out the precise nature of the offence, state that any recurrence may lead to dismissal and specify, if appropriate, the nature of the improvement required from the employee and the period in which it is required.

4. Dismissal

1. In the case of gross misconduct, or if all previous stages of the warning procedure have been exhausted, the employee will normally be dismissed. Pebble reserves the right, where reasonable, not to dismiss, but to impose other disciplinary action including (but without limitation) demotion, loss of seniority, loss of right to a pay increment or bonus or suspension with or without pay.
2. In relation to gross misconduct, such dismissal shall be without notice or payment in lieu of notice.
3. A verbal warning will remain in force for a period of six months from the date on which it was given and a first written or final warning will remain in force for a period of 9 or 12 months respectively unless stated otherwise. Any warning may be retained on the employee’s file beyond its stated validity period where it remains relevant to other decisions relating to the employee, such as pay, promotion, etc.

**Offences**

1. The following are examples of offences, which will normally lead to formal disciplinary action being taken. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and each case will be considered upon its own facts.
2. Minor offences: poor job performance involving sub-standard work, poor punctuality or any minor breach of pebble's rules.
3. Misconduct: persistent idleness, lateness or absenteeism (all absence records are monitored closely and whilst genuine absence is viewed sympathetically, pebble will investigate any excessive or unauthorised absence); failure to report absence or lateness as required and as set out in this handbook; violation of smoking regulations; disorderly conduct or abusive behaviour; soliciting money for any purpose except approved charitable causes; interfering with work of other employees; infringement of the Data Protection Act; unprofessional behaviour towards clients and/or colleagues; misuse of company property; negligence resulting in minor loss, damage or injury; or any improper behaviour, whether or not within working hours, which pebble reasonably considers to be detrimental to or conflicting with the interests of pebble or its employees.
4. Gross misconduct: negligence resulting in serious loss, damage, or injury; assault or attempted assault; the use of aggressive behaviour or excessive bad language; discrimination or harassment; theft; unauthorised possession of or malicious damage to property; wilful disregard of duties or of instructions relating to employment; deliberate and serious breach of confidence relating to pebble or pebble's business; bringing the name of pebble into disrepute; the use for personal ends of confidential information obtained in the course of the employee's employment; falsification of records; conviction of a criminal charge; intoxication during hours of work resulting from the consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs; possession of illegal drugs at work; or serious failures to comply with pebble policies and procedures and contractual obligations relating to:

- Bullying or harassment; 
- Confidentiality; 
- Health and safety; or, 
- Data protection.

**Dismissal procedure**

1. If pebble is contemplating dismissing an employee, for whatever reason, it will follow the formal procedure set out above where it is legally required to do so.

**Social events**

1. All events attached to and/or funded by work are considered to be an extension of the workplace. Any inappropriate conduct will therefore be investigated as though it took place during work time. In keeping with acceptable workplace behaviour, fighting, the use of illegal drugs and inappropriate language are prohibited and their use will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

**Probationary employees**

Employees who are still within their probationary period are not covered by this procedure. If a probationary employee is not performing satisfactorily or there are incidences of misconduct, he or she will normally be seen by his or her manager, informed of any shortcomings in performance or conduct, offered training and support (where appropriate) and warned that failure to improve will result in dismissal. If there is doubt about the employee's ability to reach a satisfactory standard, the probationary period may be extended, in which case the employee will be told of this and a new date set for the expiry of the probationary period. If the employee is unable to reach a satisfactory standard of performance or conduct, he or she will normally be invited to a formal meeting (with the right to be accompanied) prior to a decision being taken concerning his or her continued employment. 

A probationary employee who commits an act of gross misconduct will be summarily dismissed.
