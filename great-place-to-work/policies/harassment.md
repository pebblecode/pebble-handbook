# Harassment Policy

It is the aim of pebble to promote a workplace that is free of harassment. Any form of harassment occurring in the workplace or in other settings in which employees may find themselves in connection with their employment, will not be permitted or condoned by pebble. Further, any retaliation against an individual who has complained about harassment, or retaliation against individuals for co-operating with an investigation of a harassment complaint, will not be tolerated. To achieve our goal of providing a workplace free from harassment, the conduct that is described in this policy will not be tolerated and we have provided a procedure by which inappropriate conduct will be dealt with if encountered by employees.

Please note that while this policy outlines our aims of ensuring the prevention of harassment, the policy is not designed or intended to limit our authority to discipline or take remedial action for workplace conduct that we deem unacceptable, regardless of whether that conduct satisfies the definition of harassment.

This policy applies equally to employees, self-employed persons and contract workers (whether working on company premises or not) as well as to third parties such as clients, customers and suppliers.

## Definition of Harassment

Harassment in general terms means unwanted and unwelcome conduct which an individual may reasonably find offensive, which causes him or her to feel threatened, humiliated, patronised or harassed and creates an intimidating, hostile or humiliating work environment for the individual. It may be related to age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation or any personal characteristic of the individual, and may be open or covert, direct or indirect, persistent or an isolated incident. It may also include, in certain circumstances, off-duty conduct.

### Unwanted

An essential characteristic of harassment is that it is unwanted by the complainant, and therefore it is for each individual to determine reasonably what behaviour is acceptable to them and what he or she regards as offensive.

### Unacceptable

Unwanted conduct may be considered to constitute harassment if the complainant's rejection of or submission to such conduct is used explicitly or implicitly as a basis for a decision which affects that person's access to vocational training or employment, continued employment, promotion, salary or any other employment decisions, or such conduct creates an intimidating, hostile or humiliating working environment for the recipient.

### Victimisation

Victimisation occurs when a member of staff treats an existing or former member of staff less favourably because:

* That other person has in good faith brought proceedings alleging that they have been unlawfully discriminated against; or
* Has indicated that they intend to make such a claim or claims; or
* They have assisted a colleague to make such a claim, whether or not that claim is accepted as having any merit.
* Of a sexual nature

While it is not possible to list all those circumstances that may constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples of conduct which, if unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment depending upon the totality of the circumstances, the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness:

* Sexual advances - whether they involve physical touching or not;
* Sexual epithets, jokes, written or oral references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding one's sex life; comment on an individual's body, comment about an individual's sexual activity, deficiencies, or prowess;
* Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons;
* Leering, whistling, brushing against the body, sexual gestures, suggestive or insulting comments;
* Enquiries into one's sexual experiences; Discussion of one's sexual activities; Persistent sexual attention after it has been made clear by the recipient that it is offensive; and
Other conduct based on sex affecting the dignity of the recipient at work.
All employees should take special note that, as stated above, victimisation or retaliation against an individual who has complained about sexual harassment, and victimisation or retaliation against individuals for co-operating with an investigation of a sexual harassment complaint; will not be tolerated by pebble.

## Further examples of unacceptable behaviour
While it is not possible to list all those circumstances that may constitute harassment, the following are some examples of conduct which, if unwelcome, may constitute harassment depending upon the totality of the circumstances, the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness:

* Spreading malicious rumours, or insulting someone (particularly because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation);
* Copying memos that are critical about someone to others who do not need to know;
* Ridiculing or demeaning someone (particularly because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation) – picking on them or setting them up to fail;
* Exclusion or victimisation; Unfair treatment; Overbearing supervision or other misuse of power or position; and Making threats or comments about job security without foundation.
* It will not necessarily be a defence that such incidents consist of words or behaviour which might be claimed to be "common place" or which were intended as a joke or were not intended to be offensive. 

However, nothing in this policy takes away a line manager’s right to manage, including the imposition of reasonable pressure to perform or behave to an acceptable standard and where appropriate, of disciplinary sanctions. Where the line manager's conduct is a reasonable response to a perceived problem this will not constitute bullying or harassment notwithstanding that this response may cause an employee to feel under threat or otherwise distressed.

All employees will be made aware of the requirements of this policy and will be obliged to co-operate to ensure that the policy is carried out effectively. In this respect, employees should ensure that:

* They refrain from taking discriminatory actions or decisions which are contrary to either the letter or spirit of this policy;
* They do not harass, abuse or intimidate other employees, job applicants, customers, providers of services or members of the public in a manner contrary to either the letter or the spirit of this policy;
* They do not instruct, induce, or attempt to induce or pressurise other employees to act in breach of this policy; and
* They advise the company if they are aware of any discriminatory or bullying conduct, either against themselves or any third party contrary to the spirit of this policy, so that pebble can take steps to deal with it at an early stage.
* Breaches of pebble's equal opportunities and harassment policy and procedures will usually result in pebble's disciplinary procedure being invoked against the individual responsible. In serious cases the perpetrator may be dismissed.

## Complaints and disciplinary action

Where an employee believes that they are being harassed, victimised or discriminated against contrary to the law or to the equal opportunities policy they can invoke the grievance procedure, whether formal or informal, against the alleged harasser or discriminator. Employees should ensure that they keep a record of such incidents, noting the date, time and nature of the incident and also the name of anyone who may have witnessed it.

Every complaint will be investigated and dealt with sympathetically, without bias and as quickly as is practical. Pebble recognises that some complainants may prefer not to have their names used going forward. Pebble will seek to accommodate such requests as far as is practical but if pebble is unable to mention names this may limit its ability to investigate the complaint with the alleged perpetrator. This in turn may limit the extent to which pebble can pursue the complaint and/or take action against the perpetrator.

Every effort will be made to ensure that employees who make a complaint in good faith will not suffer any further detriment or be victimised because of making such a complaint. Any complaint of victimisation will be dealt with seriously, promptly and (as far as is practical) confidentially.

### Informal procedure

Prior to adopting the formal procedure set out below an informal approach may be taken. While recognising that it may not always be appropriate, pebble recommends in most cases that employees take an informal approach as the first step to stopping the harassment. This is particularly the case where the inappropriate action or omission was a one-off and/or where the employee has reason to believe that the alleged perpetrator was suffering from stress, fatigue or illness or in some other respect not functioning normally.

If the employee feels they have been subjected to harassment and/or discrimination or victimisation and considers that the informal procedure is inappropriate they should, if possible, advise the harasser that their behaviour is unwelcome, must be stopped and is interpreted by the complainant as harassment and/or discrimination and/or victimisation as defined by the company's policy statement. If preferred, this may be in writing.

If the behaviour does not cease or the employee finds approaching the harasser difficult, the employee should contact a senior member of staff. Alternatively a complainant may move to the formal procedure.

### Formal procedure

Where the informal method fails or serious harassment or discrimination occurs or if the complainant prefers, they can bring a formal complaint against the alleged harasser or discriminator. Assistance can be obtained from the employee’s line manager to help the complainant do this. The complaint should be made in writing and, where possible, state the following:

* The name of the alleged harasser/discriminator;
* The details of the harassment/discrimination/victimisation alleged;
* The date and time when the harassment/discrimination or victimisation occurred;
* The names of any witnesses to the harassment/discrimination or victimisation; and
* Details of any action, which may already have been taken by the complainant to stop the harassment/discrimination or victimisation.

The complaint should be sent or given to a senior manager. Where a complaint of harassment, discrimination or victimisation is received; consideration will be given to whether it would be helpful and/or practicable to separate the parties. This may involve a temporary transfer of the alleged harasser/discriminator or the complainant to another department or suspension with pay until the complaint has been resolved. This does not amount to a pre-determination of the matter.

On receipt of such a complaint, a thorough investigation will be carried out as quickly as possible, maintaining as much confidentiality as possible at all times. The complainant should be aware, however, that if the complaint is to be properly investigated, other employees might have to be asked for witness statements.

All employees (including the complainant) involved in the investigation are expected to respect the need for confidentiality. Failure to do so will be considered a disciplinary offence.

The complainant will be invited to a hearing to discuss their complaint. Copies of witness statements taken may be made available to both parties. Witnesses will be encouraged to appear at any hearing if requested by either party. It is acknowledged that some witnesses may be reluctant to do so. In these circumstances, the chair of the meeting will, if necessary, adjourn the hearing and ask supplementary questions of witnesses in private.

The complainant may if they wish be supported throughout the procedure and hearing by a colleague of their choice. The employee accused of harassment or discrimination will also have the right to be accompanied at the hearing in accordance with pebble's disciplinary procedures.

The complainant must make all reasonable efforts to attend the grievance hearing. If they fail to attend without proper excuse on more than one occasion, pebble may proceed with the hearing in their absence and draw such inferences as are appropriate from the material in its possession and from their absence. The complainant should bring with them any witnesses to fact or documents that they wish pebble to take into account.

If the offence is proved the severity of the penalty imposed on the harasser will be consistent with those detailed in the disciplinary procedure. Serious harassment or acts of deliberate discrimination or victimisation may result in summary dismissal. Where a lesser penalty is appropriate, for example a written warning, this may be coupled with action to ensure, as far as is practical, that the complainant is able to continue working without embarrassment or anxiety. After discussion with the complainant pebble may transfer one party to a different work area, or arrange for an amendment of working practices to minimise contact. This may depend on whether the allegation made is upheld or not, and if so, whether in whole or part only. The result of the hearing will be confirmed in writing to both parties.

### Appeal

If the matter is not resolved to the complainant's satisfaction then they may appeal in writing to their line manager or HR.

If the complainant wishes to appeal they must do so in writing within seven days of receipt of the decision. The letter should indicate the full grounds upon which the appeal is made. The conduct of the appeal shall be a matter for the appeal manager who may call such witnesses and consider such documents; as he or she feels appropriate. They may also adjourn the appeal to conduct any further enquiries that they believe are necessary. The complainant must make all reasonable efforts to attend the appeal hearing. If they fail to attend without proper excuse on more than one occasion, the company may proceed with the hearing in their absence and draw such inferences as are appropriate from the material in its possession and from their absence. The complainant should bring with them any witnesses to fact or documents that they wish pebble to take into account. Pebble will inform the complainant of its final decision after the appeal hearing. The decision made at the appeal will be final and there is no further right to appeal.

A person held to have been responsible for or involved in acts of harassment or bullying may appeal against disciplinary action taken on account of the harassment or bullying in accordance with the appeal procedure contained in the disciplinary procedure.

Employees will be protected from harassment, victimisation or discrimination for making a complaint in good faith or assisting in an investigation. Any acts of retaliation or intimidation against an employee making or assisting such a complainant will be treated as a disciplinary offence.

An employee who maliciously makes or assists in an unfounded complaint will be subject to disciplinary action and may be dismissed.

## Discipline

Any acts of discrimination or acts, which contravene this policy, may result in the disciplinary procedure being invoked against the employee responsible or involved. In severe cases, an employee may be dismissed without notice.
