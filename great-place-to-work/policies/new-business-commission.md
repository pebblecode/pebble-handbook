# New Business Commission Policy
To incentivise all staff with lead generation and our sales pipeline, there is a 2% of first year revenue available on client payment as commission for introducing a lead to the company. 

If you have a lead, please pass it on to the sales or management team and it will be recorded. Commission will be paid monthly, not on the face value of the contract signed, but on the actual money received from the client. 

Any money paid for commission would be a taxable benefit. 

If you have any questions about this, please talk to Toby.
