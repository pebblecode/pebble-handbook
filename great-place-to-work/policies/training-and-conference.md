# Training and conference policy

For employees wishing to attend a conference and gain further training/knowledge in their specialist field or to broaden their skill base, please note the following:-

- The annual budget is £500.00, however, if the cost falls over this budget then this may be approved at the discretion of your manager. If not, then the additional cost would need to be paid by the employee. 
- Up to two working days can be taken to attend the conference, any additional days will come from your holiday leave. 
- Please give as much notice as possible to your manager for confirmation, before making the booking to ensure that the timing of the conference is suitable to the needs of the business activities. 
- If the company is paying for your ticket, please contact Francesca Galluzzo who will make the purchase. 
- Please note if you are invited to speak at an event we will give the holiday day required and pay up to £250 for travel. We are assuming that if speaking, the cost of the conference will already be covered.
