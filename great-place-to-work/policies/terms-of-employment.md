# Terms of Employment

**Company property**  
Employees are responsible for any property belonging to pebble that is under their control or in their possession and must take proper care of any such items. Any deliberate or negligent failure to take proper care of company property will be viewed as misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. If an employee is required by pebble to work at home for any reason they should arrange via their line manager for the necessary equipment to be made available to them. Employees will be asked to sign for any equipment removed and will be responsible for its safe return.  
  
**Telephones **  
Telephones are for company business and should not generally be used for personal calls. It is recognised that occasionally it will be necessary to make or receive a personal telephone call at the office and these should be kept to a minimum in terms of both frequency and duration. Pebble has the right to intercept, monitor and review all telephone calls which are at any time made using pebble's telephones. Any unauthorised use of company telephones may lead to disciplinary action being taken.  
  

In the event that an employee is away from pebble's premises, for example during annual leave or sickness absence, they should be aware that their voicemail system may be checked to ensure that business needs are met.  
  
**Sickness absence**  
Employees should let their line manager know as early as possible, and no later than one hour after their normal start time, on the first day they are unable to attend work due to illness. It is not sufficient to leave a voicemail, or send a text or email message. Whenever possible, they should give an indication of the anticipated length of absence. For the period of absence employees should ensure that they remain in regular contact with the office.  
  

If an employee becomes sick whilst on holiday and is unable to benefit from it then as long as they provide their manager with a medical certificate demonstrating that they were ill during their period of pre-booked holiday pebble will treat the period of absence as sickness rather than holiday. This means the employee will receive their normal sick pay entitlement during this period and keep the holiday days booked to take at a later date.  
  

On return to work after sickness absence employees are required to complete details of their absence on the online absence system. If the absence lasts more than seven days employees must supply fit notes from their doctor to cover the whole of their period of absence.  
  

Pebble may require employees to attend a medical examination or interview with a company appointed doctor if they are off sick for a prolonged period or for repeated shorter periods.  
**_Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)_**  
SSP is available through pebble for up to a maximum of 28 weeks. Employees are entitled to payment of SSP from the 4th consecutive day of absence (including weekends and bank holidays). This is called the Period of Incapacity for Work. Employees will automatically receive this payment providing they meet the criteria laid down by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). SSP is subject to income tax and national insurance deductions.

  
SSP is a daily payment and is paid for the days that the employee would usually work (known as Qualifying Days). SSP is not paid for the first three qualifying days in any period of sickness unless it falls within a Linking Period. A linking period covers two spells or more of at least four days in a row with eight weeks or less between them. This means that employees do not need to wait for SSP for the second period of sickness.

  
The standard weekly rate of SSP is £86.70. The day rate will be calculated according to how many Qualifying Days there are in that week.

  
SSP is paid in the same way as normal wages, through the payroll.

  
Should a period of absence occur in the eight weeks prior to the date of an employee leaving pebble they may request an SSP leaver statement, which should be handed to their new employer. This will ensure any future SSP is correctly dealt with.

  
**_Company Sick Pay_**  
At the absolute discretion of the company employees may be entitled to receive their basic salary during periods of sickness absence, inclusive of SSP, up to a maximum of two weeks full pay within any period of twelve consecutive months. Any SSP due will be considered part of this payment and not an additional amount.

  
Company Sick Pay will not be payable in respect of incapacity occurring during the first three months of service. Employees who meet the qualifying conditions will receive Statutory Sick Pay.

  
Failure to comply with the notification and certification procedures as detailed above may result in the loss of Company Sick Pay.  
  

Employees will not be entitled to Company Sick Pay (except for Statutory Sick Pay) if they are off sick whilst:  

- An investigation is being carried out into an alleged act of misconduct by them or into a grievance that has been raised against or by them;
- Working out their notice period.
- Company Sick Pay may be reinstated if no disciplinary action is subsequently taken.
**_Clinical appointments_**  
Visits to doctors, dentists, hospitals and similar appointments should, whenever possible, be made early in the morning or late in the afternoon in order to minimise disruption to the working day. Where appointments are of a routine nature, they should be made sufficiently in advance to ensure an appointment at a convenient time. Pebble recognises that in emergencies it may not be possible to arrange appointments at convenient times and will accommodate emergency situations. It is in the interests of the smooth running of the office and of the co- operation of colleagues that employees do not abuse pebble's co-operation in relation to these matters.  
  
**Holidays **  
Pebble's holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December.

  
Employees’ annual entitlement is stated in their Contract. In order to minimise the disruption to the work in the office, it is important that holiday dates are requested via the online absence system, well in advance of any holiday plans. Every effort will be made to accommodate the wishes of individuals, but the needs of the company will come first and there may be times when employees cannot book holidays for their preferred dates. Employees are not permitted to take holidays without giving prior notice, and any day so taken may be treated as unpaid leave.

  
A maximum of 5 days of holiday may be carried over to the next holiday year and the total amount of holiday entitlement carried over from previous holiday year(s) must not exceed five days. There is no payment in lieu in respect of any holiday untaken at the end of the holiday year.  
  

In exceptional circumstances, or where employees have been unable to take their full holiday allowance due to operational needs, employees may be authorised to carry over a maximum of 10 days to the following holiday year. In such circumstances written approval from a company director is required, and any carried over holiday in excess of five days must be taken within the first three months of the following holiday year.  
  

On leaving employment with pebble holiday pay in lieu is payable and your entitlement will be calculated by multiplying the number of days worked in the holiday year to date by 1/260. You will be paid your basic pay for each day of holiday that you have accrued but not taken. In the event that the amount of holiday taken exceeds the entitlement at the time of leaving, the balance will be deducted from the final salary payment due.  
**_Holiday entitlement for part-time employees_**  
Part-time employees will receive a pro-rated holiday and statutory public/bank holiday entitlement.  
Entitlement to statutory and bank holidays must be taken on any statutory or bank holiday that falls on a day the employee would normally work. Thereafter, any excess allowance may be taken as normal holiday. Similarly, if there are more bank and statutory holidays falling on days the employee would normally work than their pro-rated allowance, they must take the excess from their normal holiday allowance.  
  
**Other absence **  
**_Domestic emergency_**  
In the case of an unavoidable domestic emergency, which employees should report to their line manager as soon as practicable, absence will normally be either unpaid or deducted from the employee’s annual holiday entitlement. This is, however, at the discretion of the company. Such absence must be recorded on the online HR system.  

**_Compassionate leave_**  
In the event of the death or critical illness of a member of an employee’s immediate family, pebble will grant up to 3 days’ special leave. For these purposes, immediate family consists of the employee’s spouse, parents, children and brothers and sisters. Special leave may be granted by pebble in other circumstances, but unless such leave is expressly granted, any absence will be treated either as holiday or unauthorised unpaid leave. All compassionate leave must be recorded on the online HR system.  
In some circumstances, pebble may be willing to grant periods of authorised unpaid leave. Such absence must be recorded on the online HR system.

  
**_Jury service_**  
If an employee is called upon to attend as a juror, they should advise the company immediately and supply copies of all forms. Whilst employees will be granted paid leave of absence for the first two weeks of jury service, any expenses for travel and meals should be claimed from the court.  
  

During a period of jury service, employees will be expected to undertake as much of their usual responsibilities as possible. Through the provision of reasonable and relevant equipment such as a mobile phone or laptop, employees will be able to work during the down time, the half days and before and after court sessions, which are usually shorter than the normal working day. They may also be required to make early or late visits to the office in order to be as reactive as possible to both their clients and their team.  
Employees should discuss the best way of working with their line manager prior to the commencement of the jury service, and then review progress at least once a week while they are still required by the court.  
Jury service absence must be recorded on the online absence system.  
  
**Overtime**  
Generally, pebble will not pay for any additional hours worked. It is expected that employees will work such hours as are necessary to fulfil their duties. In certain circumstances (e.g. weekend work) overtime may be paid or time off in lieu granted, but only if it has been agreed in advance.  
**Smoking**  
Smoking is prohibited in all of pebble's premises. Smoking in the office will be treated as a disciplinary offence.  
**Personal details**  
Employees must notify the company as soon as possible of any change in their personal circumstances such as address, bank account or emergency contact, and where possible update their record on the online HR system.  
**Benefits**  
Pebble presently operates the following benefits:  
Individual Stakeholder Pension Plan or if you have already an existing pension policy in place (please check with your pension provider).

Private Medical Insurance  
Dental Plan

Gym contribution

  
Pebble operates a flexible contributions scheme. This facility is designed to allow employees to make choices within the guidelines about how the total value of their benefit contribution is spent. Full details of the benefits available are set out in the pebble benefits guide, which is available on pebble’s wiki page.  
Employees should note that pebble reserves the right to alter or terminate any of these arrangements at any time.  
  
**Salary reviews**  
Salaries are reviewed annually in March at pebble’s absolute discretion and with no undertaking that an increase will be made.  
**Continuing professional development/education**  
Pebble strongly encourages employees to continue their professional development and education as it relates to their position and asks that employees regularly discuss their career goals and ambitions with their line manager. 

  
Pebble operates a 10% time initiative in which employees are encouraged to spend half a day a week working on their own projects which support their development. 

  
In some instances, pebble will provide financial assistance for work-related outside studies. If an employee is interested in pursuing outside development with pebble’s assistance, they should discuss this with the Managing Director.  
**Performance reviews**  
Employees are strongly encouraged to discuss their job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis with their manager. Formal performance reviews are conducted to provide both the employee and their manager with the opportunity to discuss positive, purposeful approaches to meeting goals.  
A formal performance review will be held towards the end of each employee’s probationary period. Thereafter pebble’s performance reviews are conducted in March and September each year.  
**Attendance and punctuality**  
In order to maintain a safe and productive work environment, pebble expects employees to be reliable and punctual in reporting for work. Poor attendance and excessive tardiness may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  
If an employee is late or absent, they should call their line manager by 09.00 a.m. to let them know.
