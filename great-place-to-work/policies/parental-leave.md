# Parental leave

**Parental leave**

All employees who have completed one year of service with pebble are entitled to 18 weeks unpaid parental leave, such leave to be taken within a five-year period from birth or adoption. Parental leave applies in relation to each child. Therefore, in the case of multiple births, the 18-week entitlement must be multiplied by the number of children. Similarly where a second child is born, employees will be entitled to an additional 18 weeks of unpaid parental leave in respect of that second child.

The right to Parental leave applies to both mothers and fathers and is in addition to current maternity/paternity leave rights.

Employees who have in the past taken part of their parental leave entitlement with a previous employer are under a duty to inform the company of such period of parental leave entitlement already taken. Pebble reserves the right to contact any previous employer(s) and seek confirmation as to whether any parental leave entitlement has already been taken whilst in the employment of such previous employer(s).

Parental leave must be taken in periods of at least one week in duration and must last for a whole number of weeks (e.g. one week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks). The employee must not take more than four weeks of parental leave in any calendar year.

Pebble requires the employee to notify pebble of their wish to take parental leave at least 21 days prior to the proposed commencement of the parental leave period.

Pebble is entitled to postpone parental leave where the needs of the business make it necessary to do so. If pebble needs to postpone the employee’s leave, the employee will be notified of the date upon which they can commence their leave.

Pebble may require the employee to produce evidence, i.e. proof of the child’s age, to support their request for parental leave and that the employee will be taking leave for the purpose of caring for their child.

The employee has a right to return from parental leave to the same job that they had before taking the period of parental leave.

The employee shall cease to be entitled to all the normal terms and conditions of employment during the parental leave period, except for those provisions relating to notice of termination, compensation in the event of redundancy and the disciplinary and grievance procedures. Throughout the parental leave period, the employee shall also be bound by all the express and implied terms and conditions of employment relating to notice of termination, confidentiality, good faith and participation in other businesses.

**Time off for antenatal appointments**

**A**s from 1 October 2014, employees in England, Wales and Scotland who have a "qualifying relationship" with a pregnant woman or her expected child, irrespective of their length of service or earnings, will have the right to take unpaid time off work to attend up to two ante-natal appointments (of up to 6.5 hours on each occasion), to accompany the woman when she attends an ante-natal  appointment made on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered nurse.
