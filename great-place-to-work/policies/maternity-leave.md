# Maternity leave & pay policy

**Time off for ante-natal care**

Where an employee has made an appointment to receive ante-natal care, she will be entitled to take time off work to attend the appointment. She must show pebble an appointment card or similar document showing that the appointment has been made, except where it is the first ante-natal care appointment. She should endeavour to arrange her appointments so as to minimise disruption to her work, i.e. early in the morning or late in the afternoon.

The employee shall be entitled to be paid her normal rate of remuneration during the time off for ante-natal care.

**Statutory maternity leave**

Regardless of length of service all female employees are entitled to 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave (OML) and 26 weeks additional maternity leave (AML), provided that they comply with the requirements set out below.

1. The employee must notify pebble in writing of her intention to take maternity leave by the 15th week before her Expected Week of Childbirth (EWC), unless this is not reasonably practicable. She must notify pebble (i) that she is pregnant (ii) the week her baby is expected to be born, and (iii) when she wants to start her maternity leave. The employee will be able to change her mind about when she wants to start her leave providing she notifies pebble at least 28 days in advance.
2. When pebble receives the employee's notification it shall notify the employee of the date on which her maximum period of maternity leave will end.
3. The employee must provide pebble with a certificate from her doctor or her midwife (form MATB1) giving the expected week of childbirth at least 28 days before she is due to commence her maternity leave.
4. The maternity leave period will begin on the earlier of:

- The date the employee has notified pebble on which she wishes the maternity leave period to begin;
- The first day, after the beginning of the fourth week before the EWC, on which the employee is absent from work wholly or partly because of her pregnancy. In such circumstances, the employee must inform pebble in writing that she is absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy as soon as is reasonably practicable; or
- The date on which childbirth occurs. In such circumstances, the employee must notify pebble that she has given birth as soon as is reasonably practicable after the birth.

Benefits during maternity leave

During the maternity leave period, the employee will not be entitled to her normal wages or salary, but may be entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance. With the exception of payment of wages and salary, the employee will continue to receive all her contractual benefits during both the OML and AML periods. During the maternity leave period, the employee shall remain subject to all the express and implied terms and conditions of employment, including notice of termination, confidentiality, good faith and exclusive service.

Entitlement to paid holiday under the Working Time Regulations is not affected by maternity leave.

Contact during maternity leave

Pebble reserves the right to maintain reasonable contact with the employee from time to time during her maternity leave, for example to discuss the employee’s return to work or developments at work during her absence.

Where appropriate, the company or the employee may request that the employee works for up to 10 days during her maternity leave period, known as ‘keeping in touch’ days. In such a case, the other party is under no obligation to agree to this request.

In the event that the employee does work during her maternity leave, up to 10 days, she will not lose her statutory benefits or entitlement to leave.

Any keeping in touch days worked do not extend the period of maternity leave and if they exceed 10 days may also bring the maternity leave period to an end.

Returning to work

The employee is not permitted by law to return to work within a period of two weeks from the date on which the child was born.

If an employee decides that she does not wish to return to work for pebble after her maternity leave period has expired she must give pebble notice of termination of employment as required by her contract of employment.

- An employee returning to work at the end of the AML period does not need to give notice of her return unless she wishes to return early.
- Employees who wish to return to work before the end of the AML period must give pebble at least eight weeks’ advance written notice specifying the date of their proposed return. If an employee fails to give this notice the company can delay her return to work until the earlier of eight weeks from the notice and the end of her AML period.
- An employee returning to work at the end of the OML period has a right to return to the job in which she was employed prior to taking maternity leave. An employee returning to work at the end of the AML period has a right to return to the job in which she was employed prior to taking maternity leave or, if it is not reasonably practicable for pebble to permit her to return to that job, to another job which is both suitable for her and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances. In the event of the employee returning to another job, her terms relating to remuneration will be not less favourable than if she had not been absent on maternity leave and her other terms and conditions will not be substantially less favourable than the terms she had been entitled to prior to maternity leave.

If it is not reasonably practicable by reason of redundancy for pebble to permit the employee to return to her existing job after her the maternity leave period, pebble is obliged to offer the employee any suitable alternative vacancy. The vacancy will only be suitable where the work is both suitable for her and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances and the capacity, place of work and other terms and conditions are not substantially less favourable than the terms she had been entitled to prior to maternity leave.

Transfer of maternity leave 

If the employee proposes to return to work early without using her full 52 week entitlement to maternity leave and gives proper notice of this, she may be eligible to transfer up to 26 weeks of her outstanding maternity leave (and outstanding SMP) to her spouse, civil partner or partner, or the father of her child, to be taken as additional paternity leave (and additional statutory paternity pay) on her return to work.

The earliest that additional paternity leave can start is 20 weeks after the date on which the employee’s child is born and it must end no later than 12 months after the date of birth. The minimum period of additional paternity leave is two consecutive weeks and the maximum period is 26 weeks. The employee must therefore have at least two weeks of her maternity leave remaining in order to be able to transfer it.

If the employee does wish to transfer part of her maternity leave entitlement in this way, she will be required to submit a written and signed declaration form to the employer of her spouse, civil partner or partner, or the father of her child, which may also make additional enquiries of pebble to verify its employee’s entitlement to additional paternity leave and pay.

Statutory maternity pay

In order to qualify for statutory maternity pay, an employee must:

- Have been employed for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week preceding the EWC;
- Have been earning a wage which is above the limit of Class 1 National Insurance Contributions;
- Still be pregnant at the commencement of the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth or have already had her baby by that date;
- Notify pebble in writing that she intends to be absent from work due wholly or partly to pregnancy or childbirth at least 28 days before the date of commencement of her absence from work or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable. The employee should also provide pebble, by the end of the third week of the statutory maternity pay period or if the employee has good cause by the end of the thirteenth week of the statutory maternity pay period, with evidence of the EWC or, where her entitlement is triggered by childbirth, the week in which childbirth occurred; and
- Have ceased to work for pebble, wholly or partly because of her pregnancy or childbirth.

The employee will be entitled to receive statutory maternity pay for a period of up to 39 weeks. The statutory maternity pay period will start on the date of the commencement of the statutory maternity leave period, except where the employee is absent from work, due wholly or partly to pregnancy or childbirth, on the first working day of any week after the beginning of the fourth week before the EWC, in which case the statutory maternity pay period will commence on the Sunday which falls on or before the date of absence.

Statutory maternity pay will be paid at the following rates:

- For the first six weeks of the statutory maternity pay period, the employee will be entitled to a weekly rate of 90% of her normal salary;
- From the seventh week to the end of the statutory maternity pay period, the employee will be entitled to the lower of 90% of her normal weekly salary or £138.18 per week.

The employee has the right to receive statutory maternity pay regardless of whether she intends to return to work for pebble. If the employee does return to work for pebble before the end of the statutory maternity pay period, she will cease to be entitled to the prescribed lower rate of statutory maternity pay and will be entitled to receive her normal remuneration, subject to any pay rise which she would have received if it were not for her absence on maternity leave.
