# Holiday policy

**Holiday Entitlement:-**

**Pebble's holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. **  

Employees’ annual entitlement is stated in their Contract. In order to minimise the disruption to the work in the office, it is important that holiday dates are requested, well in advance of any holiday plans via the online absence system **TribeHR (**signs in will be provided on your first day of employment). 

Every effort will be made to accommodate the wishes of individuals, but the needs of the company will come first and there may be times when employees cannot book holidays for their preferred dates. Employees are not permitted to take holidays without giving prior notice, and any day so taken may be treated as unpaid leave.

A maximum of 5 days of holiday may be carried over to the next holiday year and the total amount of holiday entitlement carried over from previous holiday year(s) must not exceed five days. There is no payment in lieu in respect of any holiday untaken at the end of the holiday year and these need to be used within 3 months, so before the end of March.

In exceptional circumstances, or where employees have been unable to take their full holiday allowance due to operational needs, employees may be authorised to carry over a maximum of 10 days to the following holiday year. In such circumstances written approval from a company director is required, and any carried over holiday in excess of five days must be taken within the first three months of the following holiday year.  

On leaving employment with pebble holiday pay in lieu is payable and your entitlement will be calculated by multiplying the number of days worked in the holiday year to date by 1/260. You will be paid your basic pay for each day of holiday that you have accrued but not taken. In the event that the amount of holiday taken exceeds the entitlement at the time of leaving, the balance will be deducted from the final salary payment due.
  
Christmas:- 

pebble {code} remains open for non public holidays over the Christmas period. Employees are welcome to work from home for any non public holidays in the period between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. If you wish to take the time off in between as holiday please log a holiday request as normal in TribeHR.  

**Public Holidays:- **

**England & Wales Public Holiday - For 2013, 8 days.**

**Scottish Employee's Public Holiday:-**

It is to the discretion of the employee working/living in Scotland as to whether they would choose the 

The England & Wales Public Holidays or Scottish Public Holiday.  Please note that where there is an extra day in the Scottish Public Holiday Pebble {code} will ask you to either deduct one day from your Scottish Public holiday as a working day or one day off your holiday entitlement in order to keep consistent with the rest of the employees who have 26 days (holiday entitlement) plus** 8 days** as public holidays. Please inform your line manager so this can be agreed and and updated on TribeHR Company Calender. 

**Holiday entitlement for part-time employees**  
Part-time employees will receive a pro-rated holiday and statutory public/bank holiday entitlement.  
  
Entitlement to statutory and bank holidays must be taken on any statutory or bank holiday that falls on a day the employee would normally work. Thereafter, any excess allowance may be taken as normal holiday. Similarly, if there are more bank and statutory holidays falling on days the employee would normally work than their pro-rated allowance, they must take the excess from their normal holiday allowance.
