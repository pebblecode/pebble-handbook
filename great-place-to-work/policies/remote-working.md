# Remote Working policy

**Summary**

pebble {code}'s most valuable assets are its employees. We believe that the best people aren’t all living within a commutable distance from pebble HQ, and as such structured remote working is to be offered as an option.  It is part of the company's responsibility to support employees in their choice of working environment. For some people this means working away from the pebble HQ for some or most of their working time. With a little care and attention, it is believed that a wide variety of remote working practices can be put into place to support these choices.

This document is an outline of pebble {code}’s remote working practices. It outlines the tools that pebble {code} uses and the expectations of employees when working remotely.

**Short Periods**

If you intend to work remotely for short periods, please ensure you notify everyone in the office. The best way to do this is to  let us know via Slack using the slash command”

  /wfh

You must endeavour to do this the day before you intend to stay away from the office, or at the latest by 9 a.m. on the day. 

An email update will be sent to everyone in the office at 10am to let you know who is in the office or working from home. Alternatively, you can get a live update on our dashboard (here)[http://wfh.pebblecode.com/].

**Long Period**

pebble {code} is open to the idea of having remote workers. We have had some experience of remote working in the past, and have the following caveats: 

Different timezones. Communication when working is key and not being able to get an answer within a certain timeframe is damaging for work relations and frustrating for those staff that cannot proceed.

Long distance. Some office contact time will be necessary, so long distances can make for expensive and lengthy travel. 

However, pebble will consider any desire to work remotely. It is important to us that wherever and however pebble {code} employees are working, they continue to feel part of the office. The decision to work remotely should be carefully considered, especially if when the proposed remote office is in an employee’s home, and/or working by one’s self - it is imperative that this situation works for both pebble {code} and the employee. 

**What can pebble {code} do to help long term remote workers? **

For employees who will spend more than 80% of the time remote working. 

- **Internet**. Pebble will help ensure that wherever the employee is working from, the Internet connection is fast and stable. 
- **Hardware**. Pebble will offer employees an annual budget of £900 used within your discretion for making your work environment productive and comfortable. 
This could includes Desk, Chair, Monitor, Headphones, Keyboard, Snack subscription, Spotify, Kindle books, etc.
- **Travel expenses**. If there is a requirement to come to the office for a meeting or event, pebble will cover travel expenses. 

If you are overseas, we aim to fly you back every quarter.
If you are in another city, we aim to train you back every month.
TBD: Accommodation. 

pebble {code} already organises regular office events aimed at bringing everyone together for team building and fun times.  There is an expectation that remote workers will want to attend these events and take measures to attend when possible.

**What do we need from you?**

Working remotely raises a range of practical considerations. In particular any employee wishing to work remotely for long periods should be aware of the following responsibilities:

- **Security**. As part of your daily work you may be accessing sensitive or confidential company and client information; it is your responsibility to observe the data protection rules in the company handbook and ensure that you have suitable security arrangements in place to protect your equipment and documents.
- **Insurance**. It will be your responsibility to make sure that your home insurance allows you to use part of your home as an office. If you need any advice on this pebble will do all we can to help.
- **Safety**. Pebble recognises that our workplace health and safety concerns extend to you in your home, and we will do everything we can to ensure that you have a safe working environment. We’ll need you to cooperate with us in this by complying with any health and safety assessments we make and ensuring that you maintain a suitable work station with plenty of space.
- **Property**. Any equipment we provide for you will remain company property and we ask that you take good care of it and return it to us if you stop being a remote worker or leave the company.

**Working with us**

Pebble employees are subject to the same policies, procedures and employment conditions wherever they work. We will ensure that you are always treated equally and given the same consideration as everyone else.

You will be expected to take part in the company performance review process so we can keep an eye on your career aspirations and development and you will be given the same support and training as all employees. We also have a range of practices, such as 10% time for personal projects, that we want you to feel a part of and to make this happen we ask you to stay in touch and involved with the tools below.

**Tools:**

- **Google Hangouts**. This is used for chat communications with your @pebblecode.com account. Please login during working hours so that people can get hold of you. If you are busy or do not want to be interrupted set your status accordingly. 
- **Slack**. pebble {code} makes heavy use of Slack. There are different channels for different teams. Please make sure you are in the relevant channel(s) during working hours. If you are busy and do not want to be distracted please let the room know.
- **Phone**. Please ensure that you are contactable by phone and send through contact details when you notify everyone that you are working remotely so that your team knows exactly how to get hold of you.  Pebble's VOIP software can be setup on either your laptop soft client or some compatible mobiles. 

Skype / Google Hangout. Sometime seeing a face is important - Skype or Google Hangout video calls are great for this.  All pebble employees can use their pebble Google account for Google Hangout or Skype if preferred.

# Final Note / Reminder:
We are open to discussion about changes in your circumstances. We would prefer you in the office though….

It’s nice here!
