# Equal opportunities policy

Pebble acknowledges its legal and moral obligation both in recruitment and in employment to offer equal opportunities to all persons irrespective of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation. It is contrary to our legal and moral duties to discriminate against any person because of any of those matters in respect of his or her terms and conditions of employment and opportunities for training and promotion. Pebble also acknowledges that this is a continuous on-going process, which must remain under constant review.  

- No person applying for employment will be treated less favourably than another person because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation.
- Job profiles will not require any unnecessary or inappropriate qualifications.
- We are committed to practising equality of opportunity in our terms and conditions of employment.
- If an individual has particular cultural or religious needs, or disabilities, which may conflict with existing work requirements we will always, where reasonable and practicable, seek to vary the requirements to enable such needs to be met, e.g. observance of prayer times, religious holidays.
- We will not discriminate in the provision of training opportunities. Steps will be taken to provide additional training for staff from under-represented groups to enable them to progress in appropriate circumstances.
- All employees should endeavour to create an atmosphere of equality within pebble. Senior management fully supports this policy and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the policy is known, understood and adhered to at all times.  All employees and other workers must ensure that they assist in the implementation of the policy by:
    - Co-operating with any measures introduced to develop equal opportunities; 
    - Not discriminating in the course of their employment against fellow employees, workers, clients, suppliers, or members of the public with whom contact is made; 
    - Not inducing or attempting to induce others to practice unlawful discrimination; and, 
    - Reporting any discriminatory action to the management of pebble.

If an employee believes that they or any other employee has been discriminated against or otherwise treated unfairly because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation, because of association or perception they should report the matter as soon as possible to their line manager so that there can be an investigation and consultation with a view to establishing the facts and any steps which need to be taken.  

Any form of discrimination or harassment towards any other employee or a third party because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage, civil partnership, pregnancy, maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and/or sexual orientation (together know as “Protected Characteristics”) including because of association or perception is unacceptable and may amount to gross misconduct leading to the employee’s summary dismissal without notice or payment in lieu thereof.  

Every employee is required to assist pebble to meet its commitment to provide equal opportunities in employment and avoid unlawful discrimination.  

Employees can be held personally liable as well as, or instead of, pebble for any act of unlawful discrimination. Employees who commit serious acts of harassment may be guilty of a criminal offence.  
  
Types of unlawful discrimination:  

- Direct discrimination is where a person is treated less favourably than another because of a protected characteristic, including because of perception or association.
- Indirect discrimination is where a provision, criterion or practice is applied that is discriminatory in relation to individuals who have a relevant protected characteristic such that it would be to the detriment of people who share that protected characteristic comparedwith people who do not, and it cannot be shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. 
- Harassment is where there is unwanted conduct, related to one of the protected characteristics, including because of perception or association that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity; or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. It does not matter whether or not this effect was intended by the person responsible for the conduct.
- Associative discrimination is where an individual is directly discriminated against or harassed for association with another individual who has a protected characteristic.
- Perceptive discrimination is where an individual is directly discriminated against or harassed based on a perception that he/she has a particular protected characteristic when he/she does not, in fact, have that protected characteristic.
- Third-party harassment occurs where an employee is harassed and the harassment is related to a protected characteristic by third parties such as clients or customers.
- Victimisation occurs where an employee is subjected to a detriment, because he/she made or supported a complaint or raised a grievance under the Equality Act 2010, or because he or she is suspected of doing so.

**Recruitment**

- No vacancy will be advertised or publicised (internally or externally) in a way, which discourages applications from any sector of the population.
- All applications will be considered on merit. Each individual will be assessed, as far as is practical, against a set of objective, non-discriminatory criteria, which will be directly related to the demands of the particular vacant role.
- All interviews will be conducted in accordance with the terms and spirit of this policy. The questions that candidates are asked will be closely related to the selection criteria and will be asked in order to elicit information which will give a fair assessment of that particular applicant's ability (technical and non-technical) to perform the tasks required by the vacancy.
- Pebble will endeavour to make reasonable adjustments to its arrangements for interviews and to conditions of employment for disabled applicants when aware of the need to do so to ensure so far as is practical that existing arrangements or conditions of employment do not place such applicants at an unjustified and significant disadvantage relative to other applicants.

**Terms and conditions of employment**

- Pebble will take all reasonable action to ensure that terms and conditions of employment and access to employee benefits are not offered on discriminatory grounds and are in accordance with the spirit of this policy.

**Promotion**

- Applicants for promotion will be considered only on the basis of their skill, aptitude, availability, relevant experience and general overall suitability for the vacancy. All decisions about an individual's promotion will be made in accordance with the objective selection criteria outlined in the job profile.

**Training**

- Pebble recognises that training is an important factor leading to equal opportunities at work. It will encourage employees to increase awareness, knowledge and skills for implementation of this policy.
