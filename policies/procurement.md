# Procurement policy
All procurement requests should be delivered via a manager, and that manager should email admin@pebblecode.com with the request, including quantity and a link to the exact product.

If asked to purchase a specific item, for example, given a link or make and model, at least 2 quotes should be sought before purchasing.  

For purchases over Â£100, a credit card should be used to protect pebble.

In all other scenarios, when a specific item is not suggested, be sure to confirm exact specifications with the requesting manager before purchasing. 

When selecting items to meet a procurement request, consider the following factors as equally important:

- Build quality
- Cost
- Aesthetic fit
- Fitness for purpose
- Durability
