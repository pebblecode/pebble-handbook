# Time Tracking policy
It is very important that you keep you time tracking information up to date in Harvest.  Pebble uses the information in Harvest to bill our clients.  If you fail to enter time, we don't get paid!  Please ensure that you update your time at the end of each day.  Invoicing happens on different dates for different projects, so it's important that you don't get behind.  

You should log all of the hours that you are 'at work'.  This includes time spent on billable project work as well as admin tasks related to the business.  This information is used by pebble to help us plan for future requirements.  

Enter your billable project work against the client in question, select a Task from the list - if you don't see a task that matches your activity for the day, please see your manager to create one.

For non-billable tasks, such as 10% time, HR administration, hackdays, training etc, use the appropriate Task under the project "pebble Internal".
Also please log all your holiday days too.

For a normal working day you are expected to log 8 hour and 40 hours a week.
