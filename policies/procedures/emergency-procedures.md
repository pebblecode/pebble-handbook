# Emergency procedures

Points to remember in an emergency procedure

As we share our workplace with other employers in the building the ‘emergency plans’ have been set in place and are practiced by ‘Workspace Group Plc’.

The Senior Fire Marshall of Workspace Group Plc, will notify us beforehand of the next rehearsal fire alarm drills (every 6 months), including emergency services and responsibilities actioned.

Fire exit signs and fire extinguishers are in place by the exit doors on our floor and there are daily checks to ensure the emergency doors and escape routes (hallways and stairs) are unobstructed and clearly marked. 

In an event of an evacuation procedure, please note emergency exits and observe the quick and effective way to reduce any serious consequences by adhering to the following [Fire and Safety Action Plan](https://docs.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/document/d/11ejZd19BHcXoelNPFYB3xiGYqoAHYTVGbNbPLPUsPmE/edit) for your safety.
Please wait for instructions from the Senior Fire Marshall that is is safe to re-enter the building and to resume work.

If you have any concerns, please contact Zinat.
