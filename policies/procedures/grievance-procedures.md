# Grievance procedures

**Introduction**

1. We encourage an open and honest relationship between pebble and its staff and we hope that most matters of concern to the employee can be resolved by discussion with the person to whom the employee is primarily responsible in the course of normal day to day work. The purpose of the grievance procedure is to ensure that, where this has not been possible, there is a means for matters to be raised formally.

**Formal procedure**

1. If, having raised or considered raising the issue informally, the employee has any grievances relating to their employment which they consider need to be raised formally, the employee should set out in writing as much detail as possible relating to the complaint and send it to their line manger.
2. On receipt of such complaint, pebble will invite the employee to a meeting at which the grievance will be discussed. The employee may want to make suggestions about how they think the grievance should be resolved, however the company will not be bound by these suggestions. The employee will have an opportunity to present their case and should bring any documents or witnesses they wish to rely on.
3. Where the grievance concerns or relates to other members of staff, the person dealing with it may need to talk to those members of staff, but will not do so without telling the employee first. If the employee is not prepared for it to be dealt with in this way (for example because they wish to preserve their anonymity) then the company may not always be able to resolve the matter. It may be necessary for the member(s) of staff concerned to attend any grievance hearings.
4. The employee must make all reasonable efforts to attend the grievance hearing. If the employee fails to attend without proper excuse on more than one occasion, pebble may proceed with the hearing in their absence and to draw such inferences as are appropriate from the material in its possession and from the employee’s absence.
5. Following such a meeting, the company will consider its response and inform the employee in writing of their right to appeal the company’s decision.
6. If the employee is not satisfied with the decision, they may request an appeal within five days of the decision. The letter should indicate the full grounds upon which the appeal is made. An appeal hearing will be arranged by pebble and, where possible, will be heard by a different manager.
7. At any stage of the grievance procedure the employee may be accompanied by their chosen companion, and the provisions set out above shall apply.
8. Pebble will inform the employee of its final decision after the appeal hearing. The decision made will be final and there is no further right to appeal.

**Sick pay during grievance proceedings**

1. If an employee is absent due to sickness during grievance proceedings, they will only be entitled to statutory sick pay for the duration of the proceedings
