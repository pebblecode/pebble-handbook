# Eye Test Policy

Pebble will contribute towards the cost of eye tests and eye care; Pebble provides vouchers for Specsavers Opticians which cover the full cost of an eye test. If the test reveals that spectacles are required to assist in VDU (Visual Display Unit) work, the voucher will cover a further £45 towards the cost of spectacles or contact lenses.

Employees wishing to claim for an eye test and eye care should collect a voucher from Francesca prior to arranging an appointment with the optician. 

Please note that only one claim can be made per 12 months unless the employee’s optician confirms that their condition requires a more frequent eyesight check.
