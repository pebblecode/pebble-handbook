# Discretionary Budget for Hackathon

At pebble, we like to make things; things that are fun, things that are interesting and hopefully things that useful. In the spirit of making stuff people want, we want to encourage all opportunities to make stuff. Making stuff at Hackathons allows you to play with new technology, meet new people, prototype and build something you are passionate about.

For employees wishing to attend Hackathons that are outside of company hours. We have a set up a monthly budget of £250 to be used.  

**A few key points:**

- If you are attending Hackathons in your private time, you own the IP for what you make.
- You will not be required to fly under the pebble banner.
- We cover the cost of your entrance ticket on a discretionary basis, please contact Zinat who will make the ticket purchases for you.
- We love to celebrate the achievements of pebble people and if you are interested, we would like to share your story with other pebble people.

**Whats in it for pebble? **

Talented people follow talented people. Having pebble people make amazing things and meeting new people is the most authentic way for us to meet future pebble people.
