We are sympathetic to genuine cases of illness or other problems which might make absence unavoidable. However, excessive or unauthorised absence causes disruption to the business, lowers the morale of other staff and makes us less able to accommodate genuine cases of long-term illness. Therefore, all absences are taken seriously and unnecessary absence is likely to lead to disciplinary action.

This policy aims to minimise the disruption caused by employee absence by setting clear guidelines on absence notification, by encouraging regular communication to assist employees to return to work as soon and as safely as possible, and by assisting managers to handle absences due to illness or injury in a fair, consistent and effective way.

This policy applies to all employees. It does not apply to casual workers or contractors.

## Time off for medical and dental appointments

* Wherever possible, visits to doctors, dentists, hospitals and similar appointments should be made either outside of normal working hours or made early in the morning or late in the afternoon in order to minimise disruption to the working day. 
* However, we do realise that this may not always be possible, particularly with hospital appointments.  Where appointments are of a routine nature, they should be made sufficiently in advance to ensure an appointment at a convenient time.
* Employees who have an appointment which is not at the end of the working day will normally be expected to return to work following the appointment.
* Employees who need to take time off to attend a medical or dental appointment should notify their manager, also recording this on TribeHR, giving as much notice as possible. Such time off will be paid but we do request that the time is made up.
* Pebble recognises that in emergencies it may not be possible to arrange appointments at convenient times and will accommodate emergency situations. 
* It is in the interests of the smooth running of the office and of the co-operation of colleagues that employees do not abuse pebble's co-operation in relation to these matters.

## Absence and sickness notification

* An employee who is unable to attend work for any reason should contact their line manager, as soon as possible but in any event no later than one hour after his/her normal start time on his/her first day of absence or sickness due to illness.
* In order to minimise disruption it is important that we receive as much notice of absence as practically possible. An employee who is unable to notify us personally should ensure that a relative, neighbour or friend contacts us. In addition, the reason for the absence and an indication of its likely duration should be provided. The reason for the absence will be kept confidential if this is requested.
* Absent employees are then responsible to keep their line manager informed of their situation on a regular basis. 
* They should remain in contact with us, and if away from home at any time during their absence, should provide us with full contact details. We may contact them during a period of absence and, in addition, may visit them at home to discuss their health and progress towards returning to work. 

An employee who is absent through sickness or injury for more than one week must obtain a Statement of Fitness for Work from a doctor and forward it to the line manager.

The name of the doctor, the surgery and its contact information should be clearly stated. 

* If a period of medically certified absence is extended by a further Statement, their line manager must be informed on the same day and advised of the extension of the absence.
* If a Statement of Fitness for Work indicates that the employee is unable to undertake the full duties of his/her normal job, but may be able to do some work, we will discuss this with him/her and consider any recommendations or suggestions made by the GP which may facilitate an earlier return to work.
* Sick pay will not normally be paid for any absences that are due to reasons other than the employee's own illness/injury. Any payments that apply to other absences are detailed in your contract of employment and in policies on time off - Maternity, Paternity, Parental and Adoption leave.
* Whilst absent from work due to illness or injury, employees must not take on any other work, either paid or unpaid, without our consent, irrespective of whether sick pay is still being paid. Employees remain bound by all of the terms and conditions of their contracts of employment.
* If therapeutic work is recommended, we should be informed and we will take any appropriate steps to provide this ourselves if practicable.
* Failure to comply with the above procedures could affect any entitlement to sick pay and, in some instances, could warrant disciplinary action.

## Return to work after sickness absence

It is our policy that all employees are seen on their return to work, informally, by their manager as soon as possible. The reasons for the absence will be discussed in appropriate detail depending on the nature and frequency of the absence(s).

The employee will also be briefed on any developments in his/her area of work which occurred during the absence. The manager will discuss the workload and how best to minimise any disruption that may have been caused by the absence. He or she will also need to know whether the employee is fully fit to return or should refrain from any tasks for health reasons.

* The employee is required to fill out a self-certification of absence form and the line manager will indicate whether or not payment is to be made for the period of absence in liason with the Office Manager/HR. This form will then be retained on the employee's personnel file, and payroll notified of any payment implications.
* If the absence lasts more than seven days employees must supply fit notes from their doctor to cover the whole of their period of absence and Pebble may require employees to attend a medical examination or interview with a company appointed doctor if they are off sick for a prolonged period or for repeated shorter periods.

## Long-term sickness

* We will normally make arrangements to see employees who are absent from work for a period in excess of 4 weeks. This may be either at work or at their home, to update ourselves on their progress and to ask for permission to obtain a doctor's or consultant's report. Employees may refuse their permission, but it should be emphasised that the request is made to help us manage the situation and it will usually be to their advantage to enable us to get further information about their likely date of return to work, whether any medical restrictions should be placed on their activities, and whether they have any condition which would be classed as a disability.
* Employees may, if they choose, request to take some annual leave during periods of sickness absence, or prior to returning to work. Employees who are unable to take at least their statutory holiday entitlement during our holiday year (including any bank/public holidays taken as paid leave) may carry the shortfall forward into the next holiday year, provided that they have adhered to our sickness reporting procedure and have provided required documentation where applicable. Statutory leave will continue to accrue during periods of long-term sick.
* If the absence continues at a level that we deem unacceptable, or if it becomes evident that there is little likelihood of a return to work, we will reassess the situation and may take a decision to dismiss on grounds of ill-health. 
* Before reaching a decision, we will take into account the nature of the illness, any advice we have received from a doctor, consultant or occupational health professional as to likely return to work and future capabilities, length of service, previous absence history and performance. If the absence is due to a reason related to a disability, we will also wish to explore any ways of accommodating this. If a decision is taken to dismiss, this will be confirmed in writing, together with the details of any right of appeal and our appeals procedure.

## Company Sick Pay

* At the absolute discretion of the company employees may be entitled to receive their basic salary during periods of sickness absence, inclusive of SSP, up to a maximum of two weeks full pay within any period of twelve consecutive months. Any SSP due will be considered part of this payment and not an additional amount.
* Company Sick Pay will not be payable in respect of incapacity occurring during the first three months of service. Employees who meet the qualifying conditions will receive Statutory Sick Pay.
* Failure to comply with the notification and certification procedures as detailed above may result in the loss of Company Sick Pay.
* Employees will not be entitled to Company Sick Pay (except for Statutory Sick Pay) if they are off sick whilst:
  * An investigation is being carried out into an alleged act of misconduct by them or into a grievance that has been raised against or by them;
  * Working out their notice period.
* Company Sick Pay may be reinstated if no disciplinary action is subsequently taken.

## Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

Employees are entitled to SSP provided they meet the detailed requirements of the scheme. They cannot get SSP if they are not sick for four or more days in a row as this does not form a 'period of incapacity for work' (PIW). The first three qualifying days are known as 'waiting days', and there is no entitlement to SSP for these days.

Categories employeeâ€™s are excluded from receiving SSP, if:

* their average weekly earnings are less than the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions
* they have already had 28 weeks' worth of SSP from us and this new spell of sickness links to the last one
* they were not entitled to SSP the last time they were sick, for any reason, and this spell of sickness links to that one

### To be entitled to SSP

The employee must earn at least the equivalent of Class One National Insurance Lower Earnings limit. SSP is subject to Income Tax and National Insurance deductions. The amount of SSP will be shown on the employee's payslip.

* SSP is a daily payment and is paid for the days that the employee would usually work (known as Qualifying Days).
* Linked periods of absence:- Two or more continuous spells of sickness both lasting at least four days, which are separated by 56 calendar days or less, are linked together and counted as one. This means that an employee who has already had three waiting days in a period of incapacity, and then has a second linked spell within 56 days, will be paid SSP from the first qualifying day in the second spell.
* Duration of payment: Provided the eligibility criteria are met, SSP is payable for up to 28 weeks of sickness absence in  either: one period of incapacity for work, or any number of periods linked by 56 calendar days (eight weeks) or less. These cannot extend for more than three years.

### Amount of SSP

The Government fixes the rate of SSP, which is normally reviewed annually. The standard weekly rate of SSP is Â£87.55. The day rate will be calculated according to how many Qualifying Days there are in that week.
SSP is paid in the same way as normal wages, through the payroll.
Should a period of absence occur in the eight weeks prior to the date of an employee leaving pebble they may request an SSP leaver statement, which should be handed to their new employer. This will ensure any future SSP is correctly dealt with.

## Absence whilst on holiday

An employee who falls sick either prior to commencing planned holiday absence, or during a period of paid holiday, and would otherwise be unable to take at least his/her statutory holiday entitlement under the Working Time Regulations in this holiday year (including any bank/public holidays taken as paid holiday), may request that the period of illness during the authorised holiday is converted to sick leave and the holiday taken at a later date.

In this case, the employee is required to contact their line manager on each day of the illness to confirm that he/she is ill and, if entitled to contractual sick pay during this period, provide a medical certificate covering the total period of the absence."

Note that self-certification may suffice for SSP but is not regarded as sufficient for the payment of contractual sick pay whilst absent on pre-authorised holiday. An employee who falls sick on a working day directly before or after a bank or public holiday, or directly following absence for authorised holiday, MAY be required to produce a medical certificate in order to qualify for contractual sick pay.

## Emergency time off for dependants

Our absence policy and payment schemes relate to absence due to our employees' own illness or injury, not that of other members of their family or dependants. Reasonable time off will be authorised to deal with the urgent unforeseen needs of a dependant, but this will normally be unpaid.
