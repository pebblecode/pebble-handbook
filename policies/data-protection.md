# Data Protection policy

**Policy statement**  
It is the policy of pebble to take all necessary steps to ensure that personal data held by pebble about its employees, clients, customers, suppliers and all other individuals is processed fairly and lawfully. Pebble will take all necessary steps to implement this policy.
  
It is the policy of pebble to ensure that all relevant statutory requirements are complied with and that pebble's internal procedures are monitored periodically to ensure compliance.

Pebble will implement and comply with the eight Data Protection Principles contained in the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act"), which promotes good conduct in relation to processing personal information. These principles are:  

- Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully.
- Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purpose, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
- Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
- Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. 
- Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
- Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act.
- Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction or damage to, personal data.
- Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.
Pebble has a responsibility to ensure that personal data dealt with in the course of pebble's business is handled in accordance with the Act and reasonable steps will be taken by all concerned to ensure this duty is observed.

**Responsibility**  
Data protection is a responsibility shared by all employees of pebble. Employees are expected to familiarise themselves with and observe at all times pebble's rules and procedures relating to data protection, the Data Protection policy statement and any additional instructions which may be issued from time to time.

The person having overall responsibility for data protection within pebble will be the Chief Executive Officer. Each manager and supervisor will have responsibility for data protection matters in their own immediate area of work.

It is the employee’s responsibility to ensure that all personal data provided by them to pebble is accurate and updated when appropriate.

**Processing personal data**  
Pebble will hold personal data about its employees in its manual and automated filing systems. Personal data may be processed for the purposes of:  

- Salary administration; 
- Pension administration;  
- Health insurance/benefits; 
- Training and appraisal, including performance records; 
- Disciplinary and grievance records; or
- Any other company benefit administration. 
Where the nature of an employee's employment may make it necessary or desirable for the benefit of pebble, personal information relating to that employee may be disclosed for marketing and/or PR purposes and in connection with the performance of that employee's duties.
  
In certain circumstances pebble is required to obtain the consent of employees to process their personal data. From time to time, pebble will also need to process sensitive personal data about its employees. Such data is broadly defined as including details of an individual's ethnic or racial origins, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, or data relating to the commission (or alleged commission) of any criminal offence or convictions. The employee’s explicit consent is needed to process all such data.
  
Employees’ consent to the processing of data will have been obtained by pebble prior to the commencement of their employment or as part of pebble's ongoing data protection compliance. Employees will be informed where data needs to be processed for additional purposes, and they will be informed of the purpose or purposes for which the data is intended to be processed.  
  
**Security of data**  
Employees who are required in the course of their role to process personal data about employees or customers are expected to be aware of the basic principles as set out in this policy. In particular employees should be aware of the following:  

- All personal data held by pebble must be treated as strictly confidential.
- Personal data must not be disclosed to anyone outside pebble unless the individual concerned has consented in writing to such disclosure.
- Personal data must be kept secure at all times. Personal data must not be left unattended unless it has been placed in a secure location. 
It is the responsibility of all employees to report all security breaches, or suspected security breaches, relating to unauthorised access to, or disclosure of personal data, to the CEO.
  
Breach of these guidelines may lead to disciplinary action and depending on the seriousness of the breach, may lead to summary dismissal. Breach of these guidelines may also constitute a criminal offence.

**Rights of employees**  
The Act allows employees to find out what information is held about themselves on computer and in some paper records. If an employee wishes to obtain a copy of their personal data held by pebble, they must make a written request to the CEO who will deal with their request in accordance with the Act. The employee will have to pay a statutory fee.
  
**General**  
If an employee has any questions, comments or suggestions in relation to data protection they should contact the CEO.
