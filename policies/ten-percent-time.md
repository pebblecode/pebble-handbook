# 10% Time Policy

As a company, pebble {code} strongly encourages working on personal projects for 10% of the time. It is however expected that this time is taken weekly and not accrued. The project should be tech related and the team should be kept up to date with what you are working on and how it is going. 

It is important however to recognise that pebble {code} is a client services business so while working on a client project, it is important that from day to day you are always available (unless sick or on holiday!) and that client work comes first. If this becomes a problem, please bring it up with your line manager. 

Some 10% time examples

* Learn a new programming language
* Work together with colleagues on a new idea/hack
* Try a new technology

We may from time to time, encourage you to give a brief talk on your project at a lunch & learn session.
