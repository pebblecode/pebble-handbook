# Flexible working policy

This policy has been designed to help employees to balance their home and work commitments. It applies to an employee who:

- Has been continually employed by pebble for 26 weeks at the date an application is made;
- Has a responsibility for the upbringing of a child aged 16 and under, or under 18 where disabled, or have caring responsibilities for an adult;
- Wishes to care for that child or adult; and Is one of the following:
    - The mother, father, adopter, guardian or foster parent of the child; or
    - Married to or the partner of the child's mother, father, adopter, guardian or foster parent; or
    - The spouse, partner or relative (the definition of a relative includes grandparents, parents, parents-in-law, sons, daughters, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters, brothers and sisters-in- law, sons and daughters-in-law, step-relatives, half-blood relatives, and adoptive relatives) of the adult requiring care; or
    - Living at the same address as the adult requiring care but are not a spouse, partner or relative.

**What kind of changes can be applied for?**

Eligible employees can request to:

- Change the hours they work; 
- Change the times when they are required to work; or 
- Work from home (whether for all or part of the week).

**Procedure**

**_Initial request_**

Employees are encouraged to have an informal discussion with their line manager to discuss their desire to change their working arrangements. If, following that discussion, the employee wishes to make an application to change their working arrangements, they should make a formal request.

**_Formal request_**

Employees should make a formal written request to the Managing Director, which must:

- State that the application is being made under the statutory right to request a flexible working pattern;
- Confirm that the employee has responsibility for the upbringing of the child or care of the adult, and set out their relationship to the child or adult;
- Explain what effect, if any, the employee thinks the proposed change will have on pebble and how, in their opinion, any such effect might be dealt with;
- Set out the flexible working pattern applied for;
- Give the date on which the employee wants the proposed change to take effect;
- State whether a previous application has been made to pebble and if so, when it was made; and
- Be dated.

Where possible employees should make the application at least 12 weeks before they want the change to take effect to give pebble time to properly consider it.

**_Formal meeting_**

Pebble will hold a meeting to discuss the application within 28 days of receiving a completed application form. However, this meeting may be delayed if the person who would normally deal with the application is temporarily absent or unavailable.

The employee can be accompanied to the meeting by a chosen companion. The companion must be a worker employed by pebble.

The companion can address the meeting and confer with the employee during it, but cannot answer questions on the employee's behalf.

If the companion is unable to attend the meeting, the employee can re-arrange the meeting for a date within seven days of the originally proposed time providing the new time is convenient to all parties.

**_Confirmation of decision_**

Pebble will inform the employee of its decision within 14 days of the formal meeting.

If pebble agrees to the request (including where this is subject to a satisfactory probationary period) pebble will complete all necessary paperwork and send it to the employee.

If pebble cannot agree to the request, the reasons for its decision will be confirmed to the employee in writing. The application can be refused if there is a business reason for the decision. This would cover circumstances where the refusal was due to the:

- Burden of additional costs; 
- Detrimental effect on ability to meet customer demand; 
- Inability to reorganise work among existing staff; 
- Detrimental impact on quality; 
- Detrimental impact on performance; 
- Insufficiency of work during the periods the employee proposes to work; or, 
- Planned structural changes.

There may be occasions when the viability of the proposed working arrangement is unclear and at its discretion pebble may propose that the new arrangements be the subject of a trial period. If this is proposed pebble will set down the terms of the trial, including intended duration, success criteria and the parties' rights to end it.

**_Appeal_**

An employee can appeal against pebble's decision to refuse their request within 14 days of receiving notification of the refusal.

The appeal request must: 

- Be in writing; 
- Set out the grounds of appeal in full; and
- Be dated. 

Pebble will hold a meeting with the employee to discuss the appeal within 14 days after receipt of the employee's notice.

The employee can be accompanied by their companion. The companion can address the meeting and confer with the employee during the appeal hearing, but cannot answer questions on the employee's behalf.

Pebble will inform the employee of the outcome of their appeal within 14 days of the hearing.

If pebble upholds the appeal and agrees to the employee's request the company will complete all necessary paperwork and send it to the employee.

If the appeal is refused, the grounds for the decision will be confirmed to the employee in writing.

There are no further rights to appeal against pebble's decision. Employees are only permitted to make one application each year. Each year runs from the date when the application was made.

**General**

If the employee's request or appeal is accepted by pebble the changes to the employee's terms and conditions of employment are permanent unless agreed otherwise, but subject always to pebble's right to make reasonable changes to any employee's terms of employment.
