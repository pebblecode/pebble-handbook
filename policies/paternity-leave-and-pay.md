The employee must notify pebble {code} of his or her intention to take additional paternity leave eight weeks prior to the date on which he or she wishes to start the leave. The request must be in writing and specify, in the case of a birth child, the date on which the child was expected to be born and the actual date of birth or, in the case of an adopted child, the date on which the employee was notified of having been matched with the child and the date of placement for adoption. In both cases, the notice must also specify the employee’s name and intended start date and end date of additional paternity leave and statutory paternity pay.

The employee must also submit a written and signed self-certification form not less than eight weeks before the proposed start date of additional paternity leave and pay stating that the purpose of the additional paternity leave and/or statutory paternity pay period is to care for the child and that he or she satisfies the relationship eligibility conditions for additional paternity leave and pay.

- Confirmation that the employee satisfies the relationship eligibility conditions; 
- That she or he consents to pebble processing the information contained in the declaration form; and 
- That the employee is to her or his knowledge the sole applicant for additional statutory paternity pay and, in the case of a birth child, also that the employee is to her or his knowledge the only person exercising the entitlement to additional paternity leave in respect of the child.

On request by pebble, the employee must produce the name and business address of the mother’s or primary adopter’s employer and a copy of the child’s birth certificate or, in the case of an adopted child, evidence of the name and address of the adoption agency, the date on which he or she was notified of having been matched with the child and the date on which the agency expects to place the child for adoption. The employee must supply this information within 28 days of it being requested.

The employee will be able to change his or her mind about when he or she wants to start the additional paternity leave providing he or she notifies pebble at least six weeks in advance.

Pebble will formally respond in writing to the employee’s notification of his or her additional paternity leave plans within 28 days, confirming the relevant start and end dates of additional paternity leave and pay.

**Benefits during additional paternity leave**

During the additional paternity leave period, the employee will not be entitled to his or her normal wages or salary, but may be entitled to Additional Statutory Paternity Pay. With the exception of payment of wages and salary, the employee will continue to receive all his or her contractual benefits during additional paternity leave and shall remain subject to all the express and implied terms and conditions of employment, including notice of termination, confidentiality, good faith and exclusive service.

Entitlement to paid holiday under the Working Time Regulations is not affected by paternity leave.

**Additional Statutory Paternity Pay (ASPP)**

May be payable during some of the additional paternity leave period if the mother or primary adopter has at least two weeks of her or his maternity or adoption pay period left and she or he gives proper notification in accordance with the rules set out above.

During a period of additional paternity leave, the employee will be entitled to the lower of £138.18 or 90% of the employee's normal weekly earnings. Payment of (ASAP) will only be made to an employee who is either the father of the child, or married to, or civil partner or partner of the child's mother or primary adopter.

**Contact during paternity leave**

Pebble reserves the right to maintain reasonable contact with the employee from time to time during his or her paternity leave, for example to discuss the employee’s return to work or developments at work during his or her absence.

Where appropriate, pebble or the employee may request that the employee works for up to 10 days during the additional paternity leave period, known as ‘keeping in touch’ days. In such a case, the other party is under no obligation to agree to this request.

In the event that the employee does work during his/her additional paternity leave, up to 10 days, he or she will not lose his or her statutory benefits or entitlement to leave.

Any keeping in touch days worked do not extend the period of additional paternity leave and if they exceed 10 days may also bring the additional paternity leave period to an end.
