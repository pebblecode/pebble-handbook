# Screening Candidates - Creative Technologist - Draft

## CV
Here is a brief overview of the kind of things we look out for when we review a CV or a Linkedin profile:

- **Years**: We looking for indications that the candidates are polyglot technologists who have a good understanding of software architecture, this could be least 4/5 years working experience in software development but depends on the individual
- **Title**: Titles starting with Lead or Senior are worth further inspection. Director level could be looking for much high salary expectation
- **Tech**:  C++ and Java is not what we are looking for (People with these skills tend to be more corporate/enterprise background). Look for open source technology like Go lang, Rust, JS, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Obj-C, Python etc… Working with Api’s and, Web performances is a distinct plus.
- **Companies** - Thomson Reuter for example maybe very traditional and corporate like. Folks from these businesses may not fit in well culturally and may prefer something more rigid.
- **Industry**: Ad background may bring people from a very salesy back ground and only interested in stuff that is buzz worthy
- **Leading Teams**:
  — Working in a cross functional team 
  — Working directly with designers or design teams
  — Speaks the language and principles of UX
  — Has an opinion and able to articulate the design to development workflow
  — How to prioritise features
  — Understands how design fits into Agile workflow
