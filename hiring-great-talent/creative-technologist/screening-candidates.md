## Setup Interview & Identify/Brief Panelists
The process must be inclusive and enhance cohesion in the team. It is important that every member of the team is onboard with “the sell” and why we are doing this. 

Panelists should be our most impressive people - they need to be the most discriminating and must impress the interviewee. Panels must be briefed on the candidate specification, process, scoring system and why this is such a great opportunity - they must believe! 

On interview day, we will use a bottom up 3 panel system with a Technology Lead, Design Lead, and a Consultancy Lead.

## Prepare Interview Pack for Panelists
Each panelist should have an interview pack, complete with CV, other relevant information, scoring sheet and any notes from previous interactions or interviews. 

## Face to Face - Panel interview
Each panel will have the candidate for just under 1 hour and be assessed, out of 5 (so that it matches the reviewing stars on Recruitee), on: Problem Solving, Leadership, Teamwork, Functional Competence, Company Fit. 

Each member of the panel will be given a scoring sheet and some guidance. As a rule, 4 and above is a hire… below is a no-hire! At the end of the process all scores will be totalled up and an average taken.
