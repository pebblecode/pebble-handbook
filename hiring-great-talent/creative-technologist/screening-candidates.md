## Phone - Panel Interview
The objective of the phone interview is to check that candidates meet all the requirements we are looking for in a Lead Creative Technologist role. This means delving deeper into the specifics of the candidates skills and experience discussed in their resume.

Calls should last no longer than 15-20 minutes.

5 key questions for LCT role: 

- What technologies are you excited about? 
— Check that candidates are passionate about learning new technologies
- Explain a tech stack decision? 
— polyglot technologist with experience of delivering products with different technology
- Considerations to deliver a highly performant web app?
— Solid understanding of the technical capabilities or limitations when architecting solutions.
- Where do you start with a business problem? (why? user?)
— Communication level and potential as a problem solver
- What makes a good and productive client delivery team?
— Experience acting as a hub between clients and the delivery team
(potentially another questions re UX and/or design)

It’s also important to ask the candidate what questions they have about the company or role and answer them honestly. The questions candidates ask will allow us to have a better understanding about the candidates level of interest in the role.

## Setup Interview & Identify / Brief Panelists
The process must be inclusive and enhance cohesion in the team. It is important that every member of the team is onboard with “the sell” and why we are doing this. 

Panelists should be our most impressive people - they need to be the most discriminating and must impress the interviewee. Panels must be briefed on the candidate specification, process, scoring system and why this is such a great opportunity - they must believe! 

On interview day, we will use a bottom up 3 panel system with a Technology Lead, Design Lead, and a Consultancy Lead.

## Prepare Interview Pack for Panelists
Each panelist should have an interview pack, complete with CV, other relevant information, scoring sheet and any notes from previous interactions or interviews. 

## Face to Face - Panel interview
Each panel will have the candidate for just under 1 hour and be assessed, out of 5 (so that it matches the reviewing stars on Recruitee), on: Problem Solving, Leadership, Teamwork, Functional Competence, Company Fit. 

Each member of the panel will be given a scoring sheet and some guidance. As a rule, 4 and above is a hire… below is a no-hire! At the end of the process all scores will be totalled up and an average taken.
