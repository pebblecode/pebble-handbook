# Interview Guidance
The Lead Creative Technologist is a key senior position. The new hire will be instrumental in helping pebble {code} to accelerate it’s growth. We are looking for Adaptable Generalists, rather than Motivated Specialists while we are still small.

The job will change as pebble {code} grows, and we want great people who would like to join us on this journey.

Panel Interview Guidance:

During the panel interview, our goal is to see if the candidate can do what we would like them to do and if they would fit in at pebble {code}. We are judging Potential (what are they like as a person), Quality (how they have shown their qualities), Capability (what they would be capable of doing) and Experience (what they have done). With this in mind, the scoring will be against: 

Problem Solving
Functional Competence
Leadership
Teamwork
Company Fit

ADD MORE GUIDANCE - Exercises & Workshops

Exercises & Workshops

The role of the Lead Creative Technologist is both client facing, and design & development facing. We will run a Technology panel, and a Design & Consultancy panel each at 50 minutes in duration with a 10 minute break to allow the technology panel to share their findings and insights with the Design & Consultancy panel. During the interview, the information we are gather will include:

Technology Panel

Development background

Whether they have a solid development background - i.e. they’ve actually been a developer, or done significant amounts of development, in roles before (could be earlier in their career)
Understanding what makes good code 

Preferably some code online e.g. on Github, so we can check that they can actually code well if they need to (They wouldn’t be coding much in reality, but it’d make us all feel safer about bringing them on if they could).
Web development

Specifically, a solid understanding of Web development - what kind of things are involved in developing great web apps and web services. Experience of JavaScript and the kinds of things we develop - apps, sites, APIs… (The candidate should be able to discuss topics like - when might the client be better off going with native apps vs web/hybrid apps?)
Technical Functional competency

A general sense of what kind of requirements might trigger alarm bells in terms of being very difficult, technically, versus things that are relatively easy.
Always learning / tinkering

Whether they keep up with the latest in software development - preferably still tinkering around with things themselves - or at least, following the tech news, attending events etc. Desire to keep learning and not giving off the sense that they know everything already.
.
Decision making and explanation

Ability to explain technology decisions in a clear way. E.g. through talking through recent projects. Why did they choose that tech stack? What were the trade-offs? Ability to lead/persuade on technology decisions
Understanding how development/product teams (should) work

An understanding of what makes a good development culture/environment - understanding the value of Agile ways of working (not just throwing it out as a buzzword), fast feedback loops, dev working closely with design, etc. Knowledge of the kind of things that good development teams should be doing - source control, Continuous Integration, unit testing etc.
Design + Consultancy Panel

The candidates will not be assessed on their UX level of understanding to the same degree as a UX designer, but they will need to understand and have experience bringing together both designers and developers together. We will also need to see the candidate’s approach to consulting, problem solving, planning of features and how they decide what is worth building etc.

An appreciation of the value of design

Is design an integral part of the problem solving solution for them or is it an afterthought?

Understand how designers and developers can best work together

Do they have experience bringing together both design and development team members to develop a solution?


Scoring

1 = bad
2 = potential
3 = good
4 = very good
5 = excellent

We are looking for an average score of all panelists and post interviews, those with 4+ will be offered a job. .
