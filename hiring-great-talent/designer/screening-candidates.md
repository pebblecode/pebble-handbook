#Screening Candidates - Draft

Candidate screening is the process that is designed to assess deal-breakers up front. This means that we can discount people who are clearly unsuitable. For example, if the candidate has no evidence of any relevant experience, writes ungrammatical sentences, or from a basic internet search appears to be a neo-Nazi, then we are never going to employ them. By doing this first, we save ourselves a large amount of time.

##CV Assessment
The first thing to look at is the CV. These are the 6 key tests that candidates must pass before we even look at their portfolios.

1. Degree from respected art or design college				
2. No unexplained gaps in CV													 
3. Relevant work experience														
4. Spelling & Grammar																	
5. Front-end skills																		
6. Nothing objectionable found Googling their name 		

###CV Assessment guidance
We define a respected art or design college as an institution that awards proper degrees, is accredited, and has a good reputation. We may in the future define a list of these. 

No unexplained gaps in CV should be fairly self explanatory. We don't mind if people have taken career breaks, gone travelling or had other good reasons to take time out. If they've been in prison or been fighting in Syria, we need to know at this point.

Relevant work experience includes work in creative visual fields. The more similar to the work of pebble {code} the better. Also of interest is any consultancy or client-facing roles. 

We can't employ people who don't write good. Although we are looking for people with great visual skills, it is not an excuse for illiteracy. Poor spelling and grammar means increasing everyone else's workload, as someone else will have to check their work. 

Front-end skills are becoming more and more essential for digital designers. We need people who are able to make their concepts come to life, and the reality is that nowadays we don't expect to throw everything code-based at front-end developers. So we are looking for people with great SCSS/CSS skills, and have some ability to make interactive web-based experiences without a developer holding their hand. 

It's always worthwhile Googling the candidate. If we find evidence of something that may indicate a poor fit, then this may be grounds to disqualify a candidate. 

## Portfolio Assessment
It is essential to assess the quality of a designer's prior work. The key way of doing this is via a portfolio. The portfolio can either be a document, or it can be their own personal website. Sometimes we receive links to sites such as dribbble.com. These can be OK, but in our experience those who have their own personal website tend to be best. 

There are 11 variables we look at for portfolio assessment:

1. Quality of Work
2. Evidence of Critical Thinking
3. Varied Work
4. Show Process from Start to Finish
5. Quality of Online Work
6. Impression that portfolio is candidate's own work
7. Evidence of front-end skills (HTML, CSS, SASS, JS)
8. Typography skills
9. Layout skills
10. Architecture Skills
11. Aesthetic Skills
