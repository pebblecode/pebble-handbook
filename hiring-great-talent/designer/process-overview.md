# Process Overview - Designer Interviews

##TL;DR

Design interviews are standardised to minimise the chance of recruitment errors. This is for everyone’s benefit, as mis-hires are disruptive to everyone. This document is the go-to reference for conducting design interviews to ensure:
* We interview in a professional manner;
* We establish as soon as possible if candidates are missing a ‘must-have’, thereby saving time;
* We hire the right people.

The process is:
1. Assess CV

2. Assess Portfolio

3. Phone Interview

4. Face-to-Face Interview

5. Make Offer

##Fail Fast Interview Process

We are all very busy, and recruitment can often seem like a chore that distracts us from our "proper" job. However, recruitment is vital to the succsess of the business. Given these two facts, we need to be highly efficient at conducting our recruitment process. This means that we need to find out as quickly as possible whether candidates are suitable or not for pebble {code}. This means that we need people to fail fast, if they are going to fail. In order to do this, we focus on the "must-haves"

‘Must-haves’ are attributes that we all agree candidates should have. Here are the key ‘must-haves’:
1. Candidates have an appropriate higher education qualification

2. Candidates have excellent design skills

3. Candidates have excellent interpersonal/client facing skills

4. Candidates are critical thinkers

5. Candidates have some front-end skills

6. Portfolios are truly the work of the candidates.


Our interview process is designed to establish as soon as possible whether candidates meet the requirements of our ‘must-haves’. As a general approach, we assume up front that their CV is nonsense, and their portfolio is the work of someone else. The role of the interview process is for us to attempt to disprove this assumption. 

###Higher Education
We expect everyone who joins pebble {code} to have a higher education. This is not simply because it ensures they have an academic pedigree that is desirable for the consultancy work that we undertake, but also because university also provides a set of additional transferable skills that are desirable, such as social skills, collaboration skills, confidence, and the ability to distinguish argumentation from a row. In the case of designers, we expect candidates to have a design degree from a respectable art or design college. 

*Evidence*. This attribute should be on the candidates CV. If appropriate, a general question such as ‘what did you learn from your degree?’ could be asked at interview stage. Copies of degree certificates should be obtained before the candidate is recruited. 

###Design Skills 
Obviously, every designer we recruit should have excellent skills. This includes aesthetic taste, layout, typography, hierarchies. It should also include elements of architecture, information prioritisation and navigation.

*Evidence*. The first evidence we look for is a good portfolio. It should be varied, have evidence of the thought process from the start of a project through to the finish, and demonstrate excellent finished work. Any work that is live on the internet and interactive scores bonus points. A portfolio on its own is insufficient: Candidates are required to demonstrate their skills in person. For this, we will conduct a whiteboard exercise (e.g. design a phone book). Finally, we will follow up references to check that the candidate’s former employers agree on their skills.

###Client-facing/Interpersonal. 
We cannot hire on the basis of skills alone. As we are a client-facing company, we require everyone in the team to be professional, personable and a credit to pebble {code} in front of clients.

*Evidence*. Social skills will be evident from the telephone interview. We look for people who are willing to disagree or challenge, but do so in a courteous manner. Rudeness, being monosyllabic or inarticulate, failure to maintain eye contact and lack of sense of humour are all deal-breakers. We can expect some awkwardness or nervousness in interviews, but should make every effort to put the candidate at ease so they are able to shine. 

###Critical Thinking 
We are looking for people who are able to think for themselves, hold and defend intellectual positions, provide useful critical feedback to others, and to be confident in saying they don’t know when that is the case. They should be able to distinguish argumentation from argument, i.e. not turn disagreements into rows.

*Evidence*. This thinking should be demonstrated from the telephone interview. A question should be asked that allows the candidate to demonstrate their critical question. Examples are provided below in the ‘specimen questions’ section. In the face-to-face interview, further questions can be asked. The design exercise will also uncover critical thinking.

###Front end skills 
Due to the nature of our work, and our commitment to providing actual solutions to our clients, designers should also have technical skills. This ensures that they design solutions that are deliverable, and avoid long dialogues with developers over what is and isn’t possible. 

*Evidence*. We should look for front end skills in the candidate’s CV, e.g. HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript. A further question should be asked about this at telephone interview. In the face-to-face interview, a short CSS exercise should be completed.

###Portfolio verification 
Since it is too easy to fake a portfolio, every opportunity should be taken to investigate the veracity of the work shown. The interviewers should not allow the candidate to flick through the portfolio at their own pace, rather they should control the commentary and dive deeply into one or two examples.

*Evidence*. The portfolio will be examined before the telephone interview. The interviewer will identify a particular project to focus on. By asking the candidate a set of in-depth questions about that particular project, the interviewer will be able to gauge to what extent the candidate was responsible for the work. The interviewer will record which portfolio project was investigated in the telephone interview. The face-to-face interview will investigate a different project.
