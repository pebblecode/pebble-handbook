# Phone Interview Guidance
This is an important step in the process as it can quickly weed out those candidates that just have a good CV or social presence. We have phone interview guidance below. If successful, candidate should be moved along a stage in Recruitee. 

##Overview
The phone interview should last no more than twenty minutes. The interviewer should set this expectation up front. He or she should let the interviewee know that the purpose of the interview is to say hi, get an idea of what they are like as a person, and some insight into what they've been doing recently.

The purpose of the interview is to get at whether there are any "must-haves" that are lacking. The 3 most important ones at this stage are:

4. Candidates have excellent interpersonal/client facing skills
6. Candidates are critical thinkers
7. Portfolios are truly the work of the candidates.

General questions will cover 3), and the Deep Dive will cover 6) and 7).

###Introductory Script
> Thanks for taking the time to talk to me today. My name is X and I am a designer here at pebble {code}. The way we run this is to take around fifteen to twenty minutes to talk to you about you and what you've been up to recently. We want to know what makes you tick as a designer, and how you've tackled some design challenges in the past. We're also interested in learning about your attitude to design and how you think as a designer. We'll have some time for questions at the end, but is there anything you'd like to know right now about the interview process?

###General Questions

Some obvious and simple questions should be asked at this stage. If the candidate does not have a clear answer to, for example, why they want to work at pebble {code}, they should not progress to the interview stage.

* What attracts you about working at pebble {code}?
* How do you make sure you design the right product?
* What is the project you are most proud of?
* Can you tell me about a time when you dealt with a difficult client?
* What is the role of prototyping in software design?
* What is the role of emotion in design?

###Deep Dive
In order to establish the level at which the candidate has contributed to projects, the interviewer takes a single example from the candidate's portfolio. By asking a set of questions about this particular example, we can verify the extent to which the work is the candidate's own, and how well they are able to articulate the decision making process that went into its creation. Typical questions concern a particular decision - e.g. "how did you come to the decision to use that particular pattern?" 

The interviewer should not be afraid to push a candidate on a point if they feel that they have not received a satisfactory answer. The candidate's reaction to being pressured can be revealing as to how they would deal with similar client situations. 

###Candidate Questions
The interviewer should reserve at least three minutes of the interview to deal with any questions that the candidate may have. If the candidate is truly interested in working at pebble {code} then we would expect them to have at least a few of these. In most cases you should be able to answer in a useful and succinct manner, but if the question is inappropriate or would entail a very long answer, don't be afraid to say that you can't provide a full answer now.

###Closing Script
> We've got to the end of the time allocated today. We have a number of these calls to make, so we will get back to you as soon as possible. The next step for successful candidates is a face to face interview, where we would ask you more in-depth questions about your work, and we would perform a collaborative design exercise.
