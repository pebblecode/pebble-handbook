# Creating A Candidate Specification - Draft

We are judging Potential (what are they like as a person), Quality (how they have shown their qualities), Capability (what they would be capable of doing) and Experience (what they have done). With this in mind, the scoring will be against: 


Capability - what they are like as a person
Quality - how they have shown their quality
Potential - what they will have to be capable of doing
Experience - what they have done
Package - what they will earn

NOTE FOR GROWTH COMPANIES

Job changes every day! 
Will change with the job
Great people want variety
Top candidates need to be sold on the role

As a rule, we are looking for Adaptable Generalists while we are below 150 people - rather than Motivated Specialists.

Company Overview & Potential - why us? 
Background, Role & Growth Opportunities - why the role? 
Qualities - what we want? 
Search Attributes - how we find you? experience? 
Package - what youâ€™ll make?
