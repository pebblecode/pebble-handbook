# Creating A Candidate Specification

Creating a full candidate specification document for a new role will help prepare both yourself and other team members in defining exactly the kind of candidate you are looking to bring on board.

## Solving the right problem
If you are asked to look recruit someone for pebble, you should also ask the same question we pose to our clients, “Whats the problem you are trying to solve”. Some projects needs more hands on deck, but if we are looking to hire someone with skill sets we have never hired before, it will make your life easier creating the candidate specification if you understood why we need to make such a hire. 

Look at our hiring like any other business challenge and identify which problem actually needed solving. What is the challenge pebble code has and what do we need to do to overcome that problem?

## Candidate Attributes
Most job specifications list tasks employers expect their employees to fulfil. Our approach focuses on the attributes of the person we are looking to bring into our team.

This was broken down into the following categories:

- **Capability**: The kind of skills we were looking for
- **Quality**: How they have shown their capability
- **Potential**: What they would be capable of doing
- **Experience**: Time in a particular field or industry and what they have done
- **Strategy**: How we identify and reach the people wanted to hire

### Brainstorming activity
- Using the categories outlined earlier, list as many points as you can in each section
- Highlight 3 of the most important criteria with other member of the hiring team. 

This should hopefully show where our ideas overlap and differ. Overall there should be greater overlap than differences.

Completing this activity will give you an idea of the kind of person you are looking to hire, from the candidates skills and experience to where you will likely find them.
