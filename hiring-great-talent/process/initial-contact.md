# Initial Contact
Great people are not always going to find us, we’ll need to find  them. This is a sell. If you are approaching a potential candidates you’ll need to make sure you know your stuff. Your 
first interaction might be the first contact / exposure to pebble code and this means that for the person you approach you will be the face of the company.

If you haven’t done much sales talk or advocated for something before, hopefully this document will cover the major points that should be covered. 

## Background
pebble {code} is a Technical Innovation Consultancy based in Vauxhall, London. We help businesses to innovate like startups and solve the right problems. 

pebble {code} was founded in 2010 on the basic principles of:

- always delivering awesome solutions to our clients
- and only hiring great people

We have an office full of highly talented people and very happy clients. This has allowed us to build a great working environment.
