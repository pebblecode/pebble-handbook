# Initial Contact
Great people are not always going to find us - so we must go to them. It is a sell. This guidance is for anyone approaching a potential candidate to help them tell the pebble {code} story and sell the role to the candidate. 

Background

pebble {code} was founded in 2010 on the basic principles of:

Interesting and challenging work, only
Delivery excellence, only, and
Hire great people, only.

In following these principles we have an office full of highly talented people and very happy clients. With this success we have also been able to build a really great working environment. 
Our enterprise clients cannot innovate with technology as well as they can with us. They do not have the talent, or the culture. 

Our Work

We have built gaming platforms and engines from the ground up, ideation platforms for 70000+ people, predictive investment fund platforms and mobile apps that merge the physical and digital worlds. 

Our People

We have written books, spoken at conferences, travelled the world, stayed at the bleeding edge of technology and floated technology businesses on the NASDAQ (well our Chairman has!). 

The Future

We have a great product, a great team, an almost never ending list of potential clients that want, and need our help. 

Currently 30 strong in Vauxhall, London, the world is literally our oyster and we intend to make it happen. 

This is an incredibly exciting time to join a growth business like pebble {code} and make a real difference.
