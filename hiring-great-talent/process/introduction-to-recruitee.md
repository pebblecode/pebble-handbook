# Introduction to Recruitee

Recruitee is the recruitment platform we are currently using. It allows us to list our job opportunities, source candidates with other team members and keep track of all interaction we have with the folks we interact with and the stage they are in in the recruitment process.

If you are do not yet have access to the platform, let your line manager or email jonny@pebblecode.com and we’ll add you as a recruiter on the platform.

## Sourcing candidates

If you are proactively looking for candidates for a particular role, and discover talents on twitter, linkedin or github, you can use a browser extension on Chrome of Firefox to help you add candidates to recruitee for future reference.

**Pro Tip**
If you want to get someones email, the best places to find it include, the candidates github profile, their homepage and sometimes in slideshare presentations. 
If you are super desperate - you can find their emails in the whois registration database. (though that is a little creepy, it is an option)

## Reviewing candidates

Recruitee uses a 5 star rating system. You can add and edit the kind of skills you are looking for in a particular role and the number of stars for our purposes works as follows:  

1 = bad

2 = potential

3 = good

4 = very good (4s get hired, generally)

5 = excellent

## Notes on Candidates
Recruitee is a collaborative platform, and the idea is that any team member can step in to help with the recruitment process. On the candidates profile page, there will be a section to the right for leaving small notes. Think of them as notes you want to leave for the next person looking at the candidate. If you have gotten in touch with someone, know the candidate or any other useful information that might be good to know, this is a handy place to leave a note.

## Communicating with candidates
In all candidate profile, their is an EMAILS tab where the team can use to communicate with the candidate. It’s best to send all your email communications via Recruitee because this allows other members of your team to see the conversation evolve and follow up accordingly.

One thing to also consider taking advantage of is the email templates available. You can add your own templates here too.

\* If you are sourcing candidate, you will need to find that persons email address using a little detective skills

## Moving candidates to another stage
If you have reviewed a candidate and would to move them to the next stage, there are 2 ways to do this:
- You can drag and drop candidates to the stage you want them to go in.
- You can click on the arrow button on the top right of the candidate profile and select the stage you want to put them in.

## Disqualifying Candidates
Before disqualifying a candidates, there are a few things you will want to consider doing.
- Make sure to leave your review to let others know why you made that decision.
- Send an email to the candidate to let them know they didn’t make it to the next stage. If you have done a face to face interview, it will be more courteous to tell the candidate why they didn’t make it to the next round. 
- On the candidate profile, click on the circle with a cross button not the top right.
