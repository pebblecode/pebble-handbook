# Screening Candidates - Developer - Draft

What are the 5(?) traits that we evaluate candidates on?
  - Problem solving
  - Teamwork
  - Leadership *(? what does this mean?)* <- originally for the LCT role, though this might not be as relevant for the JS developer role unless we are looking for someone senior
  - Functional Competence *(? what does this mean?)* <- Do they have the technical chops to actually hit the road running.
  - Company fit *( <— need to define this and put it here instead of just saying pebble fit)* <- Their work ethic, are they team players, or lone wolves. Are they from a really corporate back ground and would they fit in with the pebble way of doing things.

- What are the various interview stages, and what do they entail? *(is this right for us? more? less? different?)*

## CV

## Github Code Review 

Must haves:
- Github (or similar) account with at least a few repositories
- Decent code style; readable, comments, READMEs etc.

Should haves:
- Working on their own interesting problems / contributing to open source projects
- Demonstration of core skills/competencies we're looking for (i.e. JavaScript, SPAs and Node if for Full Stack JS role)
- Technology breadth; mix of front-end and back-end code

Nice-to-haves:
- Polyglot; coding in different languages
- Any projects that make us go "hey, that's cool!"
- Worked on popular projects


## Phone Interview
This is an important step in the process as it can quickly weed out those candidates that just have a good CV or social presence. We have phone interview guidance in the link below that includes what areas to focus on assessing. If successful, candidate should be moved along a stage in Recruitee.

## Phone Interview 1 
(~10-15mins)

Tell us about you, your experience, what you’re looking for, why you’re interested in pebble{code}. We’ll tell you about us, what we do, how we do it, what we’re currently working on, our aims & some challenges we’re facing. If both sides are happy with what they hear, we’ll proceed to the next stage.

If it helps, it might be useful to use up to 5 from the following questions, to help us quickly screen candidates:

- What technologies / frameworks / tools are you hoping to be able to try out soon? 

 *(Let’s us identify if they’re keen to keep learning, plus learn what kind of things they’re interested in.)*
 
- How do you follow the latest tech news? 

 *(Looking out for them attending meetups, following good developers on social media, etc.)*
 
- How would you compare Angular, Backbone and React? 

 *(Firstly tells us that they know a little bit about these, secondly that they can objectively compare things.)*
 
- What tools or libraries do you most rely on?

 *(Slightly trick question as we don't really want them to be reliant on libraries. A flag would be raised, for example, if they say they couldn't live without JQuery.)*
 
- [For Full Stack JS role] What kind of optimisations might you want to make for a mobile web app?

 *(Check they consider things such as minification, image optimisation, offline caching, request batching...)*
 
- [For Full Stack JS role] Do you prefer Promises or Callbacks and why?

 *(Check they have a basic understanding of core JavaScript constructs, are up to date enough to know about promises support, and can discuss differences.)*
 
- [For Full Stack JS role] Could you briefly explain prototypal inheritance for me?

 *(Check they understand JavaScript fundamentals and can compare to classical OOP)*

## Phone Interview 2 
(~20-30mins)

A more tech oriented chat, where we’ll talk about your past experience, tech and tools you’ve used, why you used it, your thoughts on it, what did you like about it/what didn’t you like etc.

## Coding Challenge (Not Face to Face?)
We like to evaluate candidates using real-life examples of code that they’ve worked on. You can bring in examples of some of your work to talk through with us. Ideally this would be from a professional context, but we know that this isn’t always possible, so it could be something you’ve worked on in your own time. Please note however, we’re looking for examples where you’ve had to solve a real-world problem, so a first-time tinker trying to learn a technology you’ve never used before may not be the best option. We’ll be expecting you to show us the code, talk us through it, explaining the initial problem, how you decided what to build, your choice of technology, things you did, things you didn’t do, why etc etc.

If you feel you don’t have anything suitable, that’s not a problem. Instead, we’ll ask that you complete a mini-coding exercise for us, and we’ll use that to talk through when you come in.

## Face to Face interview
(~90mins, either 3 x 30mins or 2 x 45mins)

You’ll meet various members of the company, and be interviewed by at least one of the dev team, and someone from senior management team (SMT). The dev team interview will focus further on your functional competencies, including the code example mentioned above. You may also do some pairing during this session, either on the code you brought in, or on something that we’re working on atm. This bit isn’t aimed at evaluating your coding ability, as we’ll already have a view on that, more how you work in collaboration with others and on your thought-process.

The SMT interview will be the final step, where you’ll talk with one of the founders. They play an active role in hiring, and have interviewed pretty much everyone that works here now, so they have a good idea of what they’re looking for. You won’t be doing any further exercises during this one, instead it’ll be about getting to know you a bit more, and for them to determine whether you’re right for pebble{code}, and vice versa.

## Decision
We always aim to let candidates know our decision as soon as possible after the interview process. It’s beneficial for everyone. If you’re successful, we’ll let you know and make you an offer. If you’re not, our feedback will be most valuable to you if it’s timely and current. We’ll give this to you over the phone, and would be happy to offer advice to help you in your job hunt. It’s not all negative though, we think anyone who reaches the final stages of this process is a good candidate, and won’t have any trouble finding a job. We’ll also keep your details on record in case there might be an opportunity to work together some time in the future.
