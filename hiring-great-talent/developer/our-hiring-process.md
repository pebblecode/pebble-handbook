# How we hire developers *(WIP)*

- What are the 5(?) traits that we evaluate candidates on?
  - Problem solving
  - Teamwork
  - Leadership *(? what does this mean?)*
  - Competence *(? what does this mean?)*
  - Company fit *( <-- need to define this and put it here instead of just saying pebble fit)*

- What are the various interview stages, and what do they entail? *(is this right for us? more? less? different?)*

  1. **Phone interview 1** (~10-15mins)

    Tell us about you, your experience, what you're looking for,Â why you're interested in pebble{code}. We'll tell you about us, what we do, how we do it, what we're currently working on, our aims & some challenges we're facing. If both sides are happy with what they hear, we'll proceed to the next stage.

  2. **Phone interview 2** (~20-30mins)

    A more tech oriented chat, where we'll talk about your past experience, tech and tools you've used, why you used it, your thoughts on it, what did you like about it/what didn't you like etc.

  3. **Code**

    We like to evaluate candidates using real-life examples of code that they've worked on. You can bring in examples of some of your work to talk through with us. Ideally this would be from a professional context, but we know that this isn't always possible, so it could be something you've worked on in your own time. Please note however, we're looking for examples where you've had to solve a real-world problem, so a first-time tinker trying to learn a technology you've never used before may not be the best option. We'll be expecting you to show us the code, talk us through it, explaining the initial problem, how you decided what to build, your choice of technology, things you did, things you didn't do, why etc etc.

    If you feel you don't have anything suitable, that's not a problem. Instead, we'll ask that you complete a mini-coding exercise for us, and we'll use that to talk through when you come in.

  4. **In person interview(s)** (~90mins, either 3 x 30mins or 2 x 45mins)

    You'll meet various members of the company, and be interviewed by at least one of the dev team, and someone from senior management team (SMT). The dev team interview will focus further on your functional competencies, including the code example mentioned above. You may also do some pairing during this session, either on the code you brought in, or on something that we're working on atm. This bit isn't aimed at evaluating your coding ability, as we'll already have a view on that, more how you work in collaboration with others and on your thought-process.

    The SMT interview will be the final step, where you'll talk with one of the founders. They play an active role in hiring, and have interviewed pretty much everyone that works here now, so they have a good idea of what they're looking for. You won't be doing any further exercises during this one, instead it'll be about getting to know you a bit more, and for them to determine whether you're right for pebble{code}, and vice versa.

  5. **Decision**

    We always aim to let candidates know our decision as soon as possible after the interview process. It's beneficial for everyone. If you're successful, we'll let you know and make you an offer. If you're not, our feedback will be most valuable to you if it's timely and current. We'll give this to you over the phone, and would be happy to offer advice to help you in your job hunt. It's not all negative though, we think anyone who reaches the final stages of this process is a good candidate, and won't have any trouble finding a job. We'll also keep your details on record in case there might be an opportunity to work together some time in the future.
