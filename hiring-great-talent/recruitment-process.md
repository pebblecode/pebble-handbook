# Hiring Great Talent
Since we’re going to be spending a lot of time together, we want to make sure that the people who join our teams are the kind of people you want to work with, and enjoy being around. We’d like to hire great people like you. 

Our hiring process is an open and continuously evolving one, if you have suggestions and have some ideas how we can improve things, get involved!

We’ve put together some guidance document for our recruitment:

## Create Candidate Specification

Whether you are looking to create a new role or update / improve the success rate of attracting talent, you will need to make sure that you have a clear understanding of why we need to make this hire and how this person will fit within the company. This means taking some time to think about what [problems the new hire will help us solve](https://medium.com/@pebblecode/cloning-our-founders-bd49b95e74ef) within the company. Once this is defined, we will need to create a candidate spec not only for the benefit for the people we are looking to hire, but also to make sure we also know why we are doing what we are doing.

Future pebble {code} people will learn about pebble {code} from multiple channels, the most visited channels will likely be via our careers page and candidate specification document (which includes a job description).

## Sourcing Candidates Via Ads

The easiest and most effective way to source qualified candidate is through online job posts with brand exposure via community events we have sponsored in the past. Currently the channels we are using with some success include:

### Developer roles

## Sourcing Candidates Directly

Some roles will be more difficult to fill than others. Where online advertisements doesn’t help, you may need to proactively search for these candidates using methods which could including the following channels:

- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- StackOverflow
- Blogs
- Tech and Design Events
- Team Networks
- Universities 
- Headhunters (last resort if possible)*

### Sourcing Candidates Via Competitors
There are many companies that now call themselves innovation consultancies. These could be businesses with a strong background in market research or in software development.

If you want to explore sourcing candidates from businesses similar to pebble code, you might want to look at folks from the following companies. 

**Developer track** 
Red Badger
Kainos
Thought Works
Pivitol Labs
Adaptive Labs

**Design Track**
Frog Design
Fjord (Part of Accenture)
IDEO

If you find suitable candidates, you can put them into the sourcing section of Recruitee (our recruitment platform).

\* **Headhunters** - currently we are using [Gravitas](http://www.gravitasrecruitmentgroup.com/) with mixed results, their strengths cover more enterprise level developers i.e using languages .NET, #C and #F. We are currently considering using [Zebra People](http://zebrapeople.com/) who have had success with UX Designers / Front end developers and more recently broadening their candidates skill set. We spoke with [Arran Ross-Paterson](https://twitter.com/arranrp) who sounds like he really understands how to engage with Developers and is likely to introduce the kind of candidates we are looking to hire. 

### First Contact

If you are sourcing potential candidates, it’s important to remember what it feels like to be approached by a recruiter and how painful that experience can sometimes be. While you will essentially be selling pebble {code}, it cannot come across too much like a sell. 

A few options to consider:

- Warm connections are always better, people are more receptive to people they know and trust, so where possible use our networks to get in touch with candidates.
- Getting to know people via social networks like twitter allows candidates to get to know you a little better too. It takes a more time but a more human and personal approach to connecting with someone.
- Cold phone calls are generally hated by all, but cold emails are not quite as bad. An email is always welcome if it is relevant to the candidates at the right time in their career.

## Screening Candidates

Great hires can build a great company but at the same time, poor hires will weaken performance and will be hard to get rid of. It is important that we screen candidates effectively before we meet them face to face. 

Essentially what we are looking to understand from the candidates are the following:

- Problem Solving - can they solve problems autonomously? 
- Functional Competence - do they have the chops for the job? 
- Teamwork - can they work well in a team? 
- Leadership - can they demonstrate confidence? 
- Company Fit - will they enjoy and thrive in our culture? 

The exact we we approach this will be different depending on the role we are looking to recruit:

- [Screening Developer Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/developer/screening-candidates.md)
- [Screening Designer Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/designer/screening-candidates.md)
- [Screening Creative Technologist Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/creative-technologist/screening-candidates.md)

## Compensation Planning

The compensation package will depend on the person. For the right candidate we need to be able to make an attractive offer. This will include salary, benefits, an indication of potential to grow and ideally an indication of potential bonuses. It may also be worth mentioning share options and the potential path to Technical Director of pebble {code}. Top people will require top compensation. 

## Closing the Candidate

If after the face to face interview, the team you are working with collectively feel confident about a candidate, you will need to close the candidate quickly and get an offer to the candidate by the next day at the latest. 

## Retrospective

The goal of our hiring retrospectives is to find out whats working and what isn’t so we can continuously improve all aspects of our recruitment efforts. 

Retrospectives are normally held at the end a project sprint. Hiring Retrospectives will depend on the level of your recruitment activity and your teams availability. 

For an ongoing recruitment like the developer and designer where  there is already good traction, a retrospective should be held after each new hire.

For new roles that might not have a lot of traction in attracting candidate organically such as the lead creative technologist, you will need to run retrospective more frequently as so that you can quickly make improvements in your process.
