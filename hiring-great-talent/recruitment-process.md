# Hiring Great Talent
Since we’re going to be spending a lot of time together, we want to make sure that the people who join our teams are the kind of people you want to work with, and enjoy being around. We’d like to hire great people like you. 

Our hiring process is an open and continuously evolving one, if you have suggestions and have some ideas how we can improve things, get involved!

We’ve put together some guidance document for our recruitment:

## Create Candidate Specification

Whether you are looking to create a new role or update /improve the success rate of attracting talent, you will need to make sure that you have a clear understanding of why we need to make this hire and how this person will fit within the company. This means taking some time to think about what [problems the new hire will help us solve](https://medium.com/@pebblecode/cloning-our-founders-bd49b95e74ef) within the company. Once this is defined, we will need to create a candidate spec not only for the benefit for the people we are looking to hire, but also to make sure we also know why we are doing what we are doing.

Future pebble people will be learn about pebble code from multiple channels, the most visited channels will likely be via our careers page and candidate specification document (which includes a job description).

## Sourcing Candidates

Some roles will be more difficult to fill, and where online advertisements doesn’t help, you may need to proactively search for these candidates using a number of methods which could include:

- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- StackOverflow
- Blogs
- Tech and Design Events
- Team Networks
- Universities 
- Headhunters (last resort if possible)

If we find suitable candidates, they should be put into Recruitee (our recruitment platform) into the sourcing section of each role with as much detail as possible.

### First Contact

If you are sourcing potential candidates, then it’s important to remember what it feels like to be approached by a recruiter and how painful that experience can be sometimes. While you are essentially selling pebble {code}, it cannot come across too much like one. 

A few options to consider:

- A warm connection is always welcome, where possible we use our networks to get in touch.
- Getting to know people via social networks like twitter allows candidates to get to know you a little better too. 
- Cold phone calls are generally hated by all, but cold emails are not quite as bad. Am email is always welcome if it is relevant tot he candidates at the right time in their career.

## Screening Candidates

It is important that we are able to test these candidates pre the interviews. It is the best way of understanding their ability and keenness for the role.

- [Screening Designer Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/designer/screening-candidates.md)
- [Screening Creative Technologist Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/creative-technologist/screening-candidates.md)

## Compensation Planning

This will depend on the person, but we need to be able to make an attractive offer to the candidate. This will include salary, benefits, an indication of potential to grow and ideally an indication of potential bonuses. It may also be worth mentioning share options and the potential path to Technical Director of pebble {code}. Top people will require top compensation. 

## Close Candidate

It is important that this is done quickly. We must get the offer into the hands of the candidate the next day at the latest. We must also come up with something quirky and fun that we can do to endear the candidate to the company. Ideas always welcome, but suggest pub drinks as an MVP so that the candidate can meet members of the team. 

## Retrospective

This is the most important thing (inline with client ecstasy) that we will do as a business if we are to grow. We must therefore continually improve this process by running through a retrospective after the hire/no-hire decision.
