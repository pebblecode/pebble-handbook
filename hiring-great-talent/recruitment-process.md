# Hiring Great Talent
Since we’re going to be spending a lot of time together, we want to make sure that the people who join our teams are the kind of people you want to work with, and enjoy being around. We’d like to hire great people like you. 

Our hiring process is an open and continuously evolving one, if you have suggestions and have some ideas how we can improve things, get involved!

We’ve put together some guidance document for our recruitment:

## Create Candidate Specification

Whether you are looking to create a new role or update / improve the success rate of attracting talent, you will need to make sure that you have a clear understanding of why we need to make this hire and how this person will fit within the company. This means taking some time to think about what [problems the new hire will help us solve](https://medium.com/@pebblecode/cloning-our-founders-bd49b95e74ef) within the company. Once this is defined, we will need to create a candidate spec not only for the benefit for the people we are looking to hire, but also to make sure we also know why we are doing what we are doing.

Future pebble {code} people will learn about pebble {code} from multiple channels, the most visited channels will likely be via our careers page and candidate specification document (which includes a job description).

## Sourcing Candidates Via Ads

The easiest and most effective way to source qualified candidate is through online job posts with brand exposure via community events we have sponsored in the past. Currently the channels we are using with some success include:

### Developer roles

## Sourcing Candidates Directly

Some roles will be more difficult to fill than others. Where online advertisements doesn’t help, you may need to proactively search for these candidates using methods which could including the following channels:

- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- StackOverflow
- Blogs
- Tech and Design Events
- Team Networks
- Universities 
- Headhunters (last resort if possible)*

If we find suitable candidates, they should be put into Recruitee (our recruitment platform) into the sourcing section of each role with as much detail as possible.

* Headhunters - currently we are using [Gravitas](http://www.gravitasrecruitmentgroup.com/) with mixed results, their strengths cover more enterprise level developers i.e using languages .NET, #C and #F. We are currently considering using [Zebra People](http://zebrapeople.com/) who have had success with UX Designers / Front end developers and more recently broadening their candidates skill set. We spoke with [Arran Ross-Paterson](https://twitter.com/arranrp) who sounds like he really understands how to engage with Developers and is likely to introduce the kind of candidates we are looking to hire. 

### First Contact

If you are sourcing potential candidates, then it’s important to remember what it feels like to be approached by a recruiter and how painful that experience can sometimes be. While you will essentially be selling pebble {code}, it cannot come across too much like a sell. 

A few options to consider:

- A warm connections are always better, people are more receptive to people they know and trust, so where possible use our networks to get in touch with candidates.
- Getting to know people via social networks like twitter allows candidates to get to know you a little better too. It takes a little more time but it’s a more human and personal approach to connecting with someone.
- Cold phone calls are generally hated by all, but cold emails are not quite as bad. An email is always welcome if it is relevant to the candidates at the right time in their career.

## Screening Candidates

It is important that we are able to test these candidates pre the interviews. It is the best way of understanding their ability and keenness for the role.

- [Screening Developer Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/developer/screening-candidates.md)
- [Screening Designer Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/designer/screening-candidates.md)
- [Screening Creative Technologist Candidates](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/hiring-great-talent/creative-technologist/screening-candidates.md)

## Compensation Planning

This will depend on the person, but we need to be able to make an attractive offer to the candidate. This will include salary, benefits, an indication of potential to grow and ideally an indication of potential bonuses. It may also be worth mentioning share options and the potential path to Technical Director of pebble {code}. Top people will require top compensation. 

## Close Candidate

It is important that this is done quickly. We must get the offer into the hands of the candidate the next day at the latest. We must also come up with something quirky and fun that we can do to endear the candidate to the company. Ideas always welcome, but suggest pub drinks as an MVP so that the candidate can meet members of the team. 

## Retrospective

This is the most important thing (inline with client ecstasy) that we will do as a business if we are to grow. We must therefore continually improve this process by running through a retrospective after the hire/no-hire decision.
