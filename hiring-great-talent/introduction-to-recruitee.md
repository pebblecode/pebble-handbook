# Introduction to Recruitee

Recruitee is the recruitment platform we are currently using. It allows us to list our job opportunities, source candidates with other team members and keep track of all interaction we have with the folks we interact with and the stage they are in in the recruitment process.

If you are do not yet have access to the platform, let your line manager or [Jonny](jonny@pebblecode.com) know and weâ€™ll add you as a recruiter on the platform.

## Sourcing candidates

If you are proactively looking for candidates for a particular role, and discover talents on twitter, linkedin or github, you can use a browser extension on Chrome of Firefox to help you add candidates to recruitee for future reference.

**Pro Tip**
If you want to get someones email, the best places to find it include, the candidates github profile, their homepage and sometimes in slideshare presentations. 
If you are super desperate - you can find their emails in the whois registration database. (though that is a little creepy, it is an option)

## Reviewing candidates

Recruitee uses a 5 star rating system. You can add and edit the kind of skills you are looking for in a particular role and the number of stars for our purposes works as follows:  

1 = bad
2 = potential
3 = good
4 = very good (4s get hired, generally)
5 = excellent
