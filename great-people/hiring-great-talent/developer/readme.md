# The Developer Role at pebble {code}

After an initial discussion, we have settled on the following characteristics as the ones that we value the most. This constitutes what we call, **The pebble way**. That is not to say that we disregard all else, but these are the most important to us, and are what we will be evaluating you on. If someone demonstrates all of these, chances are we would make them an offer. This is a work in progress, and will most likely be subject to change.

#### 1. you are an open-minded creative technologist

You are not wedded to a particular programming language, or environment, or tool. You are able to demonstrate this through your prior experience, or through personal projects. Whilst you may hold strong opinions on particular technologies, these opinions are loosely held. You are open-minded about new technology and the future. You have a demonstrable thirst for learning.

#### 2. you are an adept and relentless problem-solver

No one knows everything. All we do is solve the problem in front of us using all of the information that we have available to us at that time. Therefore, you should be able to demonstrate critical thinking, ask inquisitive questions, and have a bias towards to action.

#### 3. you work predominantly with, and care the most about, web technologies

Is this a contradiction to **1**? Perhaps. Suffice to say that we are not, for example, an iOS dev shop. For now, the vast majority of the work we do is web based and we use open source technologies to deliver the best possible web experiences for our clients. If you're not a fan of developing for the web, we're probably not the right place for you at this time.

#### 4. you are an excellent communicator

Software development is as much about people as it is tech. If not more. You are comfortable conversing with a wide range of people, such as developers, designers, and non-technical clients. You can explain your ideas in such a way that is clear and accessible, and in group discussions, you are inclusive and empathetic.

#### 5. you favour working collaboratively and relish all the challenges that involves

We think the biggest contributor to team happiness is collaboration. We are social animals after all. Most of the time you'll be working with one or more other people. You care about how the team organises, sharing lessons learned, and each team members happiness. You should be comfortable pair-programming, taking part in retrospectives, and seeking feedback on everything you do. Everything is a continual process, and we all work together on trying to improve it.

# Interviewing

The aim of the interview process is to assess a candidate on these aspects. Different parts of the process will target different traits, enabling us to evaluate the whole set at the end. Details on the process can be found [in the screening document](great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer/process/01-screening-candidates.md).

Hopefully this is a useful aid. If anyone has any feedback or questions, feel free to open an issue and start the discussion!
