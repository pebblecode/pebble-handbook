How to measure candidates?
==========================

I think it is great that there are already a number of values that you judge
candidates against; this is essential.

However, it might take me some time to really understand those values and there
_may_ be some inconsistency in how they are applied. I have written this
document to help solve those problems. It is intended to cover the current
process and suggestions for improvement. Hopefully, we can use this as part of
on-boarding new recruiters.

This should be considered as a starting point. Please update this with the
questions you currently ask.

I've attempted to specify break each value down to three guidance sections:
* Qualities a good candidate would possess and how they are evidenced.
* Suggestions for interview questions and exercises that you can ask
* Negative qualities to watch out for

Note that this is guidance, rather than mandatory. For example, that means if a
candidate does not have a Github or Bitbucket profile it is not an instant fail,
but instead we might want to consider asking for some additional sample code or
add extra questions.

In addition, this document is not a proposal for a new interview format.
The questions and examples are things we can consider adding into the existing process.

Commentary and questions in italics.

Values
======

## 1. you are an open-minded creative technologist

- _Does this break into two parts, creative and open-minded?_

### A good candidate would:
* Have a number of technologies/platforms/languages on their CV
  - or alternatively the lack of variety could be motivating their move.
* Have a GitHub/open-source account with their own repositories?
  - _What makes a good GitHub account?_
  - _Is reading their code meaningful measure of creativity? Might be better to
    assess creativity by looking at the novelty and variety of their creations._
* Be a [Generalizing Specialist](http://blog.codinghorror.com/swiss-army-knife-or-generalizing-specialist/) aka [T-Shaped person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills)
* Have a inclination to choose the right tool for the job.
* have experience working on a full-stack.

### Interview questions/exercises:
* Give an example of a project where you've chosen (or been given) a new
  technology to work with and it went well? What about one that didn't go so well?
* What's their go-to tool of choice? What is it good/bad at? When would they
  pick a different tech?
* Give a brief example of one of our projects (for example, like Votes For
  Schools) and ask for some technology choices and simple description of
  architecture.

### Things to watch out for:
* Jack of all trades master of none: the candidate should have at at least one
  main language. Preferably one that we use.
* Technology magpie: always picks the latest framework/language with no focus on
  delivery.
* Self-describing back-end or front-end coders, we want full-stack.  

## 2. you are an adept and relentless problem-solver

Three things are explicitly called out which need evidence:

- demonstrate critical thinking
- inquisitive questions
- bias to action

_Are there other qualities to demonstrate this value?_

_Google famously used "brainteasers" to test problem solving ability, but, [according
to Laszlo Bock](http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/200732/google-admits-its-famous-job-interview-questions-were-a-complete-waste-of-time/) these proved to be "a complete waste of time"._

### A good candidate would:
* Always seek clarity on the problem.
* Explores options.
* Can quickly imagine what a reasonable solution might look like.

### Interview questions/exercises:
* Tell me about a difficult problem you had to solve?
* Describe a time when you took action without being asked?
* Tell me about a time you had to make a recommendation?
_These might sound a bit lame, but they do work_

### Things to watch out for:
* Not considering what problems that might create for others.
* Perfectionists; perfection is the enemy of getting things done.
* [Yak shaving](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that.html)

## 3. you work predominantly with, and care the most about, web technologies

### A good candidate would:
* Have extensive experience developing web with technologies on their CV.
* Some web-related personal projects.
  - _are we going to have the discpline to look at their code properly? how do we evaulate a personal project?_ 

### Interview questions/exercises:
* Battleships
  - _I think this is reasonable question, but could be improved._
    - _Is command line good? Should we be more prescriptive about what we expect
    from a good answer_
* _Any Specific technical questions?_

_We should probably have more here as this is what you spend your time doing_

### Things to watch out for:
* Try to be collaborative, but avoid giving the answers away

## 4. you are an excellent communicator

### A good candidate would:
* clearly explain their ideas

### Interview questions/exercises:
* A collaborate exercise can work well. Something framed like pair-programming.
* Tell me about a time when you've had to work with someone non-technical to deliver a project?
* 

### Things to watch out for:
* 

## 5. you favour working collaboratively and relish all the challenges that involves

### A good candidate would:
* Have experience/exposure to with Agile methods

### Interview questions/exercises:
* Describe a time when you've had to work with a difficult person/client?
* Tell me about a time when you've had to work with another team?

### Things to watch out for:
* People who prefer silos.
