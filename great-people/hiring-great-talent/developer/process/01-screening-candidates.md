# Screening Candidates

What are the traits that we evaluate candidates on? See [the profile document for details](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer/profile.md).

Currently, our screening process is comprised of the following. Details on each step can be found in the next section

1. Initial screening (conducted by pebble on provided materials)
2. Coding exercise (carried out by candidate in their own time)
3. Phone interview
4. Office interview

#### 1. Initial Screening

Based on CV and cover email, and any code samples that are public or provided by the candidate.

#### 2. [Coding Exercise](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer/process/02-code-test.md)

We like to evaluate candidates using real-life examples of code that they’ve worked on. Ideally this would be from a professional context, but that this isn’t always possible. In the absence of that, we’ll ask that you complete a mini-coding exercise for us, and we’ll use that to talk through, and pair on, when you come in. (Details of exact nature of exercise to be confirmed).

If you do wish to send us a previous project, feel free to do so. Please note however, we’re looking for examples where you’ve had to solve a real-world problem, so a first-time tinker trying to learn a technology you’ve never used before may not be the best option. We’ll be expecting you to show us the code, talk us through it, explain the initial problem, how you decided what to build, your choice of technology, things you did, things you didn’t do, why etc etc.

#### 3. [Phone Interview](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer/process/03-phone-interview.md) (~15-20mins)

This is an important step in the process as it can quickly weed out those candidates that just have a good CV or social presence. We want to spend the first 5-10mins building rapport, so just ask them about themselves to begin with. This should lead into a broader conversation about technology, their experience and opinions. Finally, we can talk about pebble, and do describe what we do and how we do it etc. Below are some examples of what we might ask a candidate about.

* What technologies / frameworks / tools have you used recently?
* What's your opinion on (*thing they mentioned in previous answer)? What did you like, what didn't you like?
* What do you want to learn next?
* Tell us about a project you've worked on that you particularly enjoyed. What did you enjoy? Why?

#### 4. [Office Interview](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer/process/how-to-measure.md) (~90mins)

You’ll meet various members of the company, and be interviewed by at least one of the dev team, and someone from senior management team (SMT). The dev team interview will focus further on your functional competencies, including the code example mentioned above. You will also do some pairing during this session, either on the code exercise we set you, or on something that we’re working on atm. This bit isn’t aimed at evaluating your coding ability, as we’ll already have a view on that, more how you work in collaboration with others and on your approach to problem-solving.

The SMT interview will be the final step, where you’ll talk with one of the founders. They play an active role in hiring, and have interviewed pretty much everyone that works here now, so they have a good idea of what they’re looking for. You won’t be doing any further exercises during this one, instead it’ll be about getting to know you a bit more, and for them to determine whether you’re right for pebble{code}, and vice versa.

# Decision

We always aim to let candidates know our decision as soon as possible after the interview process. It’s beneficial for everyone. If you’re successful, we’ll let you know and make you an offer. If you’re not, our feedback will be most valuable to you if it’s timely and current. We’ll give this to you over the phone, and would be happy to offer advice to help you in your job hunt. It’s not all negative though, we think anyone who reaches the final stages of this process is a good candidate, and won’t have any trouble finding a job. We’ll also keep your details on record in case there might be an opportunity to work together some time in the future.

As ever, this can and should be subject to change. Open an issue and start the conversation.
