#Train Questionnaire Exercise

##Introduction
This is the exercise that we use to assess people's design skills in an interview. It is an ostensibly simple task that has a few tricky sections. We expect the designer candidate to grasp the nature of the task, and ask the right questions. 

For this task you will need the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17961414/interviews/C2C_Wireframes.pdf" target="_blank">following wireframes</a>

##The Task

A National Rail operator needs to improve passenger satisfaction. They want to understand how presentable their stations are on a regular basis. pebble {code} has been tasked with creating a system that allows them to monitor the state of stations. 

This monitoring is done by a set of people who visit all the stations and fill out a questionnaire. We are designing that questionnaire. It is a web app that will be delivered on an Android Tablet. 

A partial design for the app is included. The user can select which station they have visited, and they can start a new assessment. 

We would like you to design the first page of the assessment. The requirements are as follows:


_The page needs to show:_

Progress through questionnaire
Station Name

_The page needs to allow the user to:_

* Choose whether the floor is dry or wet
* Choose a weather condition from following:
  * Sunny
  * Light Rain
  * Heavy Rain
  * Snow
* Select whether the following aspects of the signage are OK:
  * Branded correctly
  * Lit Clearly
  * Clean 
  * Undamaged
* Add a photo for any no answers for the signage

The app will be built in HTML5, and is primarily for use on touch screen devices.
