# Panel Interview Guidance
The role of the Lead Creative Technologist is both client facing, and design & development facing. We will run a Technology panel, and a Design & Consultancy panel each at 50 minutes in duration with a 10 minute break to allow the technology panel to share their findings and insights with the Design & Consultancy panel. During the interview, the information we are gather will include:

### Technology Panel

#### Development background
Whether they have a solid development background - i.e. they’ve actually been a developer, or done significant amounts of development, in roles before (could be earlier in their career)

#### Understanding what makes good code
Preferably some code online e.g. on Github, so we can check that they can actually code well if they need to (They wouldn’t be coding much in reality, but it’d make us all feel safer about bringing them on if they could).

#### Web development
Specifically, a solid understanding of Web development - what kind of things are involved in developing great web apps and web services. Experience of JavaScript and the kinds of things we develop - apps, sites, APIs… (The candidate should be able to discuss topics like - when might the client be better off going with native apps vs web/hybrid apps?)

#### Technical Functional competency
A general sense of what kind of requirements might trigger alarm bells in terms of being very difficult, technically, versus things that are relatively easy.

#### Always learning / tinkering
Whether they keep up with the latest in software development - preferably still tinkering around with things themselves - or at least, following the tech news, attending events etc. Desire to keep learning and not giving off the sense that they know everything already.
#### Decision making and explanation
Ability to explain technology decisions in a clear way. E.g. through talking through recent projects. Why did they choose that tech stack? What were the trade-offs? Ability to lead/persuade on technology decisions

#### Understanding how development/product teams (should) work
An understanding of what makes a good development culture/environment - understanding the value of Agile ways of working (not just throwing it out as a buzzword), fast feedback loops, dev working closely with design, etc. Knowledge of the kind of things that good development teams should be doing - source control, Continuous Integration, unit testing etc.

### Design Panel
The candidates will not be assessed on their UX level of understanding to the same degree as a UX designer, but they will need to understand and have experience bringing together both designers and developers together. We will also need to see the candidate’s approach to consulting, problem solving, planning of features and how they decide what is worth building etc.

#### An appreciation of the value of design
Is design an integral part of the problem solving solution for them or is it an afterthought?
Understand how designers and developers can best work together
Do they have experience bringing together both design and development team members to develop a solution?

### Consultancy Panel
Successful problem solving requires finding the right solutions to the right problem. We'll need to see how the candidate solves problems for their clients. Do they try to fully understanding the problem space, before identifying the problems they need to focus on?
Are they an excellent communicator, able to explain, persuade and justify decisions to strong technical teams and non technical clients alike, able to see the wood for the trees and not afraid to point out difficult truths. We are looking for someone that has the confidence to say no rather than nod along to requirements.
