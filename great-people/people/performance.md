#### Performance

#### 

 

The performance review process is intended to give you clarity on your job progress and to help us understand what further support or training you need from us. The review meeting is an important opportunity for you to discuss your opinions on your job role, performance, development and training needs and we hope you will be prepared to contribute your views.

We want to help you develop your career wherever you want it to go, and we're happy to hear from you whenever you have some thoughts on how things are going or what you want to achieve.

We hope that you will speak to your manager regularly regarding your performance, but we also hold formal performance reviews. These are held in March and September each year and documented online through [TribeHR](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpebblecode.mytribehr.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzd0887hZhmOeC9cGY7GjbroLxYFMw). When your time has come, you will receive an email inviting you to complete a self appraisal form prior to a meeting with your manager.

The reviews are important in giving you clarity on your performance and helping to plot your career ahead, so please spend some time thinking about what you want to get from them. There are some guidance notes below to help and you can also find the competencies that we assess for your role in the subpages of this category.

In order to have a successful review meeting with positive outcomes we ask that you spend some time in preparation for your meeting.You should consider: 

- what you have achieved during the review period, with examples and evidence;
- any examples of objectives not achieved, with explanations;
- what you most enjoy about the job and how you might want to develop the role;
- any aspect of the work in which improvement is required and how this might be achieved;
- your learning and development needs, with arguments to support your case for specific training; • what level of support and guidance you require from your manager;
- your aspirations for the future;
- objectives for the next review period.

We will always aim to make sure there are tangible outcomes from your review meeting to support you in your employment with pebble {code}. While the review meeting is part of our formal performance review process, we are all always interested in your development and ambitions and encourage you to talk to us about your progress on a regular basis.
