# Share Options (EMIs)

**So, what are EMI Share Options?! **

**Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs)**

pebble {code} has set up an EMI share options scheme. Employees with over 1 year of service are eligible. We have set this up to enable everyone to participate alongside us in the long term success of the business.

Unlike the direct ownership qualities of shares, a share option is the right, but not the obligation, to buy a share in pebble {code} at a specific price on or after a certain date. 

Until, and only if, you chose to exercise this right, you do not hold any shares in pebble {code}. 

The government has made remuneration through EMI share options very tax efficient:

- The grant of the option is free from National Insurance and Income Tax.
- If the EMI option is exercised within ten years and assuming there are no disqualifying events, there will be no Income Tax or National Insurance contributions due.
- Capital Gains Tax is a tax that may be due if you make a gain on the disposal of your shares after having exercised the option.

**Some FAQs**

**_So I’m getting some share options - thanks pebble, but what does that mean?_**

The scheme gives you the opportunity to own a chunk of this business in return for all the hard work you’ve put in and will continue to do so over the coming years!

**_Are you giving me shares in pebble {code}? That would be great ;­)_**

Not quite, if we just gave them to you we’d both get a big tax bill, so instead you are being given (or ‘granted’ as it’s normally known) an opportunity (known as an ‘option’) to buy shares in the future for a set price.

**_Thanks a lot, but how much is it going to cost me?!_**

Firstly, it depends how many share options you are granted, and the company valuation at the time. To start with though, it will not cost you anything. If in the future if you decide that you want to exchange (known as ‘exercising your option’) some of these ‘options’ into real shares, you’ll be paying some money for them then (though its usually not a huge sum).

**_What if I don’t want them in the future?_**

No big deal, you don’t have to exchange (‘exercise’) them and it won’t cost you a penny if you decide not to. And no, you won’t get anything else for them or be able to give them to anyone else!

**_How will I know if its worth me exchanging them or exercising them as you say?_**

Let’s say that the price (known as a ‘strike price’) when you are granted one of these options is £1 and you were given 1,000 options. After a period of time (3 years in this case) you could exercise them into 1,000 shares by paying us £1,000. Before you make that decision though you would want to know what the current ‘price’ of the shares were and what the future expectation of the business is so you can decide.

For example, through your hard work, pebble {code} has exploded, and in 3 years the value of the shares has gone up to £10 each – this would be a no brainer and you should cough up the £1,000 – deal done. You would be a shareholder with 1,000 shares worth £10,000 and sitting pretty for the future.

**_So can I give you £1,000 now and have my shares?_**

Sorry, no. The options have a lock­-in period (known as the ‘vesting’) so that until that time has passed you don’t have the right to exercise them. You’d also still need to be an employee at the company when the vesting time has passed.

**_So If I leave in two years what happens?_**

If your 1,000 options had a 3 year vesting period and you complete 2 years successfully and you are a ‘good leaver’ (more about this later) you would be able to exercise 666 of those 1,000 options at £1. You then write us a cheque for £666 and 666 shares will be yours.

**_Can I be given more options?_**

Absolutely - we plan to use share options as another way to reward employees, based on your performance and the performance of the company.

**_Can I exchange my options for money?_**

No exchanging options for money, love or beer – they are yours and yours only. It is a different matter once you’ve exercised them into ‘real’ shares but as options they live, exercise and die with you.

**_What will the taxman take?_**

This is the really clever part. Going back to our earlier example; you are granted £1 options and after the 3 years of vesting you decide to exercise those options, you pay us £1,000 and you have 1,000 shares. A year or so after that we are bought out for £9/share. As a shareholder you will receive a £9,000 cheque in the post. The tax you pay on that will be capital gains tax only. You’ll be taxed at 18% and maybe even 10% depending on how many shares you have and pending changes in the new finance act.

For example, you sell 1,000 shares for £9/each ­- you have made a £9,000 ‘capital disposal’

You paid £1,000 for the shares ­- so you have made a taxable Capital Gain of £8,000.

Here, as you have an annual exemption (i.e. what capital gain you can make in a year without paying any tax) of £10,600 – this particular sale isn’t going to cost anything. If over the £10,600 it will be taxed at 18% or 10%. Good news is, nothing else to pay, no NI, no income tax.

If in this example you had 10,000 shares sold for £9/each, your total disposal would be £90k, your gain would be the £90k less the £10k you paid to ‘acquire’ the shares when you exercised them,  i.e. an £80k taxable gain. To work out what you pay tax on and assuming you had no other capital gains in that particular tax year – take away the £10.6k annual capital gain allowance you would be taxed at 10% or 18% on around £70k.

**_So what’s next?_**

In September (*or February if that is how long it has taken us to sort this out!) we will send you a statement detailing the EMI options you are being granted today (if eligible), as well as the terms associated with these options. You will also be provided with a copy of the EMI Share Option Plan Rules and EMI Share Option Agreement, both of which will require your signature, should you wish to participate. 

Please read these documents carefully and do not hesitate to raise any questions you might have.
