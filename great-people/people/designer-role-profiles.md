# The Designer Role Profiles

Outlined below are skills/traits/behaviours relating to the various levels of being a designer @ pebble {code}. The demonstration of these are what we believe makes a great designer. This isn't a script, or a checklist to follow. It is deliberately non-prescriptive to allow people to pursue specific goals related to their career, but the overall themes should be applicable to everyone. These are the things that we value in designers, and they may form part of your evaluation relating to performance/salary.

**Note:** the recruitment guidelines should serve as a precursor to this document. If you haven't read that yet, [please do so here](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/tree/master/great-people/hiring-great-talent/designer).

This is a *non-exhaustive* list, and the groups should be considered to be cumulative, such that being a lead designer would means displaying the attributes from the previous categories.

Salary levels have been omitted while the discussions around pebble remuneration continue. There is also an awareness that the UX role should in some way fit in to this tiering, but that is still to be resolved.
