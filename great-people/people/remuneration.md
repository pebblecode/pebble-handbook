# Remuneration

Your remuneration is linked to [performance](https://sites.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/wiki/archived/performance) but will not be discussed during your performance reviews. A good performance review however will obviously count toward your salary review, which will be once a year in March. 

Increases in salary, or bonuses, may also happen at other times if you are promoted. 

There is no set bonus structure here at pebble {code} - bonuses are based on company and individual performance. 

Any questions, please ask [Toby](mailto:toby@pebblecode.com).
