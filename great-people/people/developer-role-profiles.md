# The Developer Role Profiles

Outlined below are skills/traits/behaviours relating to the various levels of being a developer @ pebble {code}. Whilst we do not adhere to tiered roles (junior, senior etc), the demonstration of these are what we believe makes a great software developer. This isn't a script, or a checklist to follow. It is deliberately non-prescriptive to allow people to pursue specific goals related to their career, but the overall themes should be applicable to everyone. These are the things that we value in developers, and they will form part of the evaluation during reviews and salaries.

*Note*, the recruitment guidelines should serve as a precursor to this document. If you haven't read that yet, [please do so here](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/tree/master/great-people/hiring-great-talent/developer).

The details are grouped according to levels of experience and ability, analogous to junior - mid - senior, but not in any way related to job titles.

They are also entirely uncoupled from length of service.
