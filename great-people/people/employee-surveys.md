# Employee Surveys

**Results of the April 2013 Employee Survey**

The survey was conducted with 4 main themes in mind: Your Job, Your Company, Your Management and We Are Pebble. In very general terms, the results were very positive. 

- **Your Job **Generally very positive, with the biggest area that we need to focus on being the performance management process. We asked some specific questions about the PM process as we already knew that it can be improved. Our pledge is to deliver a performance management process that works well and is not too admin intensive.   

- **Your Company **Again, generally very positive. Most people seem very happy with the office, but a few hinted at potential improvements, which we are very keen to do. We are currently assessing various office expansion options.   
  
If you are interested in more information on the mission and goals of the company, then please read [here](https://sites.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/wiki/company/strategy). Going forward, we will be sending out more regular new business updates and tweaks to strategy and ideas.  
  
Lastly, we are continually assessing your remuneration and take getting this right very seriously.   
  
- **Your Management **This section came out very positive in that most people felt that they had adequate time and guidance from their manager and that they were happy going to their manager with ideas or questions. This is great.   
- **We Are Pebble  **This section was about having an understanding of what people thought about the pebble brand when considering both pebble {code} and pebble.it. Generally the responses came back positive but I think that what they told us was that there is more we could do to firstly explain the relationship, and secondly organise some things that we can all do together - be it work or play.    
  
In a nutshell, pebble {code} and pebble.it are two separate entities that share some founders, an office, a brand and most importantly, a philosophy for delivering first class tech. If we can learn from each other, we should.
