# Cyclescheme

The Cyclescheme allows you purchase a tax free bike through monthly salary reductions. 

This can save you up to 32% of the total cost of the bike. 

There are several shops you can buy your shiny bike from all you need to do is give us the information of the bike and shop and we will get the ball rolling.
