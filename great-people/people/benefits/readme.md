# Benefits

pebble currently operates a flexible contribution benefits scheme which all employees are entitled to join on successful completion of their probation period.

As of 1st November, pebble will contribute 3% of your gross monthly salary per month for each employee to ‘spend’ as they wish across the available benefits. Employees may, although they are not obliged to, contribute further from their own salary to increase the level of their benefits. pebble’s contribution can apply to either one benefit or can be spread across many.

The benefits currently available  as part of the scheme are:-

- [Pension Plan](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/people/benefits/pension-plan.md)  
- [Medical Cover](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/people/benefits/medical-cover.md)
- [Health Cash Plan](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/people/benefits/health-cash-plan.md)
- [Dental Plan](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/people/benefits/dental-plan.md)
- [Gym Membership](https://github.com/pebblecode/pebble-handbook/blob/master/people/benefits/gym-membership.md)
