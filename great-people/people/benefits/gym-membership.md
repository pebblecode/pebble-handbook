# Personal Gym Membership

As part of your benefit options, personal gym membership is available to you!

Set up process

Please contact your preferred Gym and set up a monthly direct-debit to leave from your personal bank account. Please provide a copy of the receipts of payment to the Office Assistant for Administration purposes. 

Payroll

Please note for payroll purposes, the gym payment will be recorded as a separate entry on your payslip for PAYE/NI purposes as follows:- Showing your monthly gym figure as being deducted from your gross salary, as well as pebble crediting this amount plus tax given back to you on the amount.

It gets paid back into your salary plus the tax given back to.

If a gym £60 a month, wish to pay that for an employee we pay ni and tax on put it through payroll and he gets £100 then after tax £60.  (it's taxable).

As this is an individual gym membership, it is not technically classed as a benefit, where as if it was a company gym membership this would then be classed as a benefit.

However as pebble contributes your gym membership back to you, it is seen from an employee’s point of view as a benefit.  

Please make sure that the price range falls into your 3% salary bracket. 

Now bend those knees!!!
