## Role
[Lead Creative Technologist](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/creative-technologist)

## Ask me about:
- *Agile*: I've shipped many a project as part of Agile teams, been a Scrum Master and try to answer [Agile/Scrum questions on Stackexchange](http://stackexchange.com/filters/99472/agile-scrum). I'm also a big advocate for XP practices and Continuous Delivery.
- *Distributed Systems*: my experience in MMO game development and finance has given me a solid understanding of building distributed systems. 
- *Games Development*: making games is a fun, satifying and creative experience. I've spent over half my career doing it so I know at least a bit about most stuff, jack-of-all-trades.
- *Architecture*: I've taken a high-level view of projects many times and been responsible for integration of systems.
- *Legacy code*: I can help you get your code base productive again!
- *Build, package management and CI*: build hygiene is an essential part of scaling teams working on products. 

## Professional Interest 
- I'm less interested in specific tools, such as, languages and more interested in what it actually takes to ship sortware. This pushes me towards organisational stuff like Agile methodologies and other areas.
- I also have an interest in Distributed Databases and Message-oriented-middleware because they share some of the same characteristics as the distributed systems I've built in the past. 

## What do you want to do in the future (Career Goals)
- Learn more about working in a consultancy for now.
- Get stuff shipped.
- Help make engineering culture great!
