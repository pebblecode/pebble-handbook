## Role
[Lead Creative Technologist](/great-people/hiring-great-talent/creative-technologist)

## Ask me about:
- Agile: I've shipped many a project as part of Agile teams, been a Scrum Master and try to answer [Agile/Scrum questions on Stackexchange](http://stackexchange.com/filters/99472/agile-scrum). I'm also a big advocate for XP practices and Continuous Delivery.
- Distributed Systems: my experience in MMO game development and finance has given me a solid understanding of building distributed systems. I also have a passing interest in distributed databases and messaging middleware because they share some of the same characteristics.
- Games Development: making games is a fun, satifying and creative experience. I've spent over half my career doing it so I know at least a bit about most stuff, jack-of-all-trades.
- Architecture: I've taken a high-level view of projects many times and been responsible for integration.
