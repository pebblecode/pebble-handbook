## Role
Full-stack Javascript Developer

## Ask me about:
**JavaScript** - I've been working with Node and front-end JS for years. Although I've dabbled with others, Node is my chosen language for anything beyond simple scripts and one-liners.

**Bash/Unix tools** - My unix-fu/bash-wizardry is pretty good. I know lots of tricks and tools and can usually slap together a powerful one-liner damn quickly.

**Linux** - I've been working with Linux for a while. I've been running Ubuntu as my main home machine since 10.04 and experimenting since I was a kid. My previous company was a Linux cloud provider that also worked on a container protocol similar to Docker, so I learnt quite a bit about that, as well as the kernel in general.

## What are you working on for your 10% time?
All sorts! I have been dedicated to working on a "Sunday Project" for about 2 years, and it's generally something like:
- API/Open data hacking (see [theguardianhivemind.com](http://theguardianhivemind.com))
- Games (see [jonny.net/portico](http://jonny.net/portico))
- Pointless HTML5 shenanigans (see [jonny.net/noiz](http://jonny.net/noiz))

## Professional Interests
Start-ups, development, product management, technology, strategy, marketing

## What do you want to do in the future (Career Goals)
- Start a company
- Work internationally
- Smash it

## What do you do for fun?
- Learn languages! I am a keen linguist. I speak fluent Italian, and am working on my Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, French and Spanish. Next step: be less eurocentric.
- Travel! I have spent ~10% of my life in Norway and Italy, respectively.
- Swimming! I've been to loads of pools all across London, and I have my favourites.
- Biking! When it's mild and dry I like to cycle. I'm afraid of the rain because I'm highly soluble.
