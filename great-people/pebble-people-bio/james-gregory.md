## Role

.NET Developer

## Ask me about:

*F# and functional programming* - After many years of fixing bugs in various relatively complex systems I have grown a severe aversion inheritance and shared state, and it's nice to use a language that purposefully guides you to alternatives.

*Enterprise software patterns & buzzwords* - After many years of fixing bugs in various relatively complex systems I've learnt a bit about web services, message buses, databases, caching, event sourcing, modelling domain logic, opening tickets with ops, repeatedly uninstalling virus scanners, etc.

## What fields are you interested in now?

- Getting better at programming generally, by practicing
- I try to keep up with the rapidly changing world of .NET - Azure, ASP.NET vNext & CoreCLR, the various OSS F# libraries, the various competing actor frameworks, etc
- I try to keep up with the rapidly changing world of JavaScript - currently learning about TypeScript and Angular 2
- I continue to very slowly learn a bit more about how operating systems and networks function at a low level
- At a pop-science level I think maths, machine learning, and computational statistics are interesting, but I don't pretend to know anything about them
 
## What events do you go to

- F# things. Partly because I like F#, partly because more generalist software development events in London are so over-subscribed and/or expensive I can't be bothered.

## What do you do for fun?

- running, would be nice to beat my PB in the London marathon
- a bit of cycling, walking, and indoor bouldering
- watching Downton Abbey
- reading books very slowly
- drinking tea
