## Role
Tech Lead & Advocate (developer) 

## Ask me about:

- *JavaScript* - Bit of a Jack-of-all-trades, but just let me know if I can help!
- *3D* - I've developed a few prototypes with Three.js now.
- *Mobile apps* - I've developed an Android app in Java and some iOS bits with Objective-C, but I'm mostly familiar with 
Cordova.

## What are you working on for your 10% time?

I've tended to use 10% time to prepare talks, or been bad and used it to catch up on client work. My first idea 
is to try to do something with Machine Learning. If you're interested in this area too, please join the 
`#machine-learning` channel on Slack.

## What do you want to do in the future (Career Goals)

I'm keen to contribute at pebble {code} by:

- Helping our clients to make great products
- Helping more developers to be aware of pebble {code} and helping to hire great people
- Helping to gain great client work

Personally I would also like to:

- Gain more experience of successful product delivery
- Contribute to open source projects  
- Grow a reputation as an innovator and a speaker

## What fields are you interested in now?

- Anything new in web development
- Amazing things you can do with JavaScript (I'm hoping to update/improve my "I Can't Believe It's JavaScript" talk)
- 'Future tech' like virtual reality and augmented reality.
- I'm currently writing a blog post about developer habits, inspired by [Gordan's lightning talk](http://pebblecode.com/blog/august-lightning-talks/)

## What events do you go to

I mainly go to JavaScript / front-end events, but I like to mix it up a bit too. Here's my 
[Meetup profile](http://www.meetup.com/members/9448293/) and [Lanyrd profile](http://lanyrd.com/profile/poshaughnessy/).

## What do you do for fun?

- Run, cycle and occasionally undertake an outdoor adventure
