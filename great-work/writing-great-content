# Writing Great Content
Some notes on structuring your thoughts and writing great content, for the blog etc. 

## 1. Have a governing thought. 
What is the theme? What do you want to the reader to do as a result of your article? 

## 2. Split your thinking into 3. 
Common way to do this is: 
* Situation
* Complication
* Resolution

## 3. And 3 again! 
For each of the above, split your thinking into 3, and 3 again. 

## For example: 
Governing Thought: Go Digital To Win

1. Bede Gaming success story (for example)
- Starting condition
- The journey
- The result

2. Digital Benefits
- Agilitiy & speed (time)
- Better products (quality)
- Lower costs (cost)

3. Digital Cookbook
- Right Approach (people & culture, Agile governance, supporting infrastructure)
- Right Thing (user-centred, Lean)
- Thing Right (Agile practices, Lean, right roles)

Super helpful to visualise and critique quickly with peers if applicable. 
Hope this helps.
