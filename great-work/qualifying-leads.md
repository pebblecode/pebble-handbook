# Qualifying Leads

It is not uncommon for us to be introduced to someone in a company and for us to have an introductory meeting with them.

We are developing a technique for making these meetings as useful as possible both for us and for the prospective client.

## Scenario

We have a meeting scheduled with Arthur Dent, Senior Manager: Digital Innovation of Dent Co on 26th October. We know he is interested in creating more digital products within Dent Co but beyond that nothing.

## Qualifying the opportunity

Before talking about the problem collectively we need to qualify the problem. We are proposing that the following is a technique that can deliver this.

* Interview the contact
* Find out who the contact is
* Discover what the technology landscape is in the industry
* Look at who the company is hiring
* Conduct some research on the company

### Interview the contact

This is the highest return means of discovery and this should be prioritised. For both us and the client a successful meeting is more likely if the client can brief us on why they have requested the meeting. It is our job to uncover requirements in the meeting but framing the discussion helps us to achieve that. If we can interview the contact ahead of time some relevant questions include:

* What is your biggest problem at the moment?
* What would get you promoted in six months?
* What is the goal of your job?

### Find out who the contact is

Understanding who the contact is and where they sit in the company can help in framing a discussion. Normally we can discover via LinkedIn which team they are in. This can lead to an understanding of their collegues and the things they are interested in. Normally we can then source social media profiles to see the types of things they are interested in. If we can understand that all the contact has been talking about for the last two months is digital transformation then this can help us prepare for the meeting.

### Discover what the technology landscape is in the industry

Going into the meeting with an understanding of the general technology landscape of an industry will lead to a better meeting. Let's suppose that Dent Co is a telecommunications company. We should be able to understand what's happening in the industry through press, analyst reports and potentially through people in the office. The output of this analysis should be a short summary of what's driving and affecting the industry so other members of the team can quickly understand it. 

### Look at who the company is hiring

A great indicator of company strategy is the people they are looking to hire right now. By looking at their careers site and assessing who they are hiring in technology  we can potentially undestand the direction they are heading in. For example if a company is hiring lots of Data Analytics Professionals there is a good chance they are looking at Business Intelligence. Often the job adverts will give away snippets of strategy too.

### Research the company

There is a wealth of information around publically traded companies. Looks at analyst and press reports and try to understand what has happening in the last 12 months. Ask yourself some questions like

* Has the share price gone up or down? Why?
* Have they had any major changes in leadership? Why?
* What is their stated strategy?

## Divide and conquer

It is suggested that syndicating these tasks amongst a team of four and then coming together to present one-pager summaries on each topic lessens the workload and also leads to a greater understanding in each area. A meeting can then be scheduled where the team can plan for the meeting and pull together relevant opinion and potentially work we have already done.
