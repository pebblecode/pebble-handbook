# Social Media guidance for sharing content

We want to improve our ability to attract new talent and business leads. This means building a brand worth following, and worth learning from. 

We are working on creating content consistently, and regularly. This is talked about here: Creating content worth sharing

This guide is about how we go about getting the right eye balls to see the content.

## The regular channels
We are on a few channels listed below, the audience consume information differently in each channel, here is a quick intro:

- Twitter: Any content is okay here, reposts or pebble own content. The thing that needs some consideration is that content here is time sensitive and you may want to schedule a time that will get the most eyeballs.
- Facebook fan pages: People are interested in pebble on this channel, they will expect pebble related content here
- Linkedin: People here are either looking for a job or looking for a business need.
- Youtube/Vimeo: No limitations here. 

We are using Buffer to schedule tweets and track engagement on content here. We are on the 5 user business account at the moment so if you are interested in sharing content, let one of the account holders know and we’ll get this up online.

Account holders:
- George
- Toby
- Clorama
- Jonny

If you are interested in sharing content more regularly, let Jonny know and he’ll share his login with you.

### A noobs guide to Hashtags
Mainly for Twitter and Instagram but is starting to become a thing in Facebook too (Like taking pictures at work? Send pics to Clo - no nudes please). This can be handy for discoverability for people who specifically search via the Hash links. 

If you worry about being “One of those hashtag people”, Don’t worry! In moderation and being super targeted, this can be super useful for getting people who are not following you to discover the piece. 

### sharing to @soandso
If you know someone who might be interested in your piece, add them along with the post. It doesn’t matter if you know the person personally or not, just think of it as an invitation to use this as a talking point. If you receive something you like, chances are, you will share that with your network and thats a nice thing. 

## The niche channels
If you have written a piece that solves a problem or answers a question, there is a good chance that someone has asked the question before. Beyond the regular social channels, Q&A sites are also good places to share your content. We don’t have pebble accounts here, it’s not the kind of place to have a company account. You might want to share your content piece directly here, it’s more human to have the person sharing the content to also be the content writer here. Here are a few of the big ones:

- Quora
- Reddit
- HackerNews

If there is a specific channel that might be good to be on, add them below.
