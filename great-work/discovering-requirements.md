# Establish a goal for the project

Every project should have a single sentence goal. Some examples include

* Put a man on the moon by the end of the decade
* Sell the product to X

Establishing a goal can uncover many things about a project. You may find that that the goal is unclear on the client side. Establishing a goal allows an entire team to galvanise around an outcome, to work towards it and to celebrate milestones and an ultimate success. It can also help reduce the chances of failure but having a common reference point that everyone on the project can refer to.
