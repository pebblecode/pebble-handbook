Agile Software Development @ pebble {code}
==========================================

* **What**: Agile is a collection of software development methodologies that support the values of the Agile Manifesto.
* **Why**: Agile teams collaborate and adapt with the minimum overhead to deliver quality software.
* **Who**: Developers and customers work together through the entire project and communicate daily.

The Team
========
* **Customer**: Writes user stories, sets priorities and gives feedback. When there are multiple stakeholders someone should be selected to be the primary contact.
* **Team**: Developers and designers work together to estimates stories, defines tasks and design, implement and test the software product.
* **Lead**: Coaches the team, ensures process is followed.

Release Early & Often
=====================

* **What**: project is broken up into mini-projects, each with a small set of features that take only a few weeks to implement
* **Why**: Building software is a process of discovery; the only way to tell how it will actually be used is in the hands of real users. 
*

Sprint Meetings
===============
* **Planning**: Prioritisation, Select Goal, Task Breakdown
* **Stand-up/Scrum**: Daily, 15 minutes, quick status update. Not for problem solving 
* **Review**: what the team has delivered each sprint with the customer 
* **Retrospective**: Inspect and adapt each sprint. Also see Kaizen 

Sprint Planning
===============
* **What**: Set the goal for the sprint. Break down into user stories and tasks that can be completed within the sprint.
* **Why**: Planning helps with predictability of delivery
* **Who**: only the team
* **When**: Before each sprint begins

Daily Stand Up
==============
* **What**: As a minimum, each team member answers three questions:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Is anything slowing you down?
* **Why**: communication with your peers, not for reporting management
* **Who**: Anyone can attend, but only those actually on the team answer those questions.

Review
======
* **What**: the team shows what they’ve done during the sprint. No PowerPoint!
* **Why**: Verify that the team met its goal and share what has been done to the reset of the team.
* **Who**: Performed by the team. Attended by: customers, management, maybe other developers.

Retrospectives
==============
* **What**: Inspect and adapt your process
* **Why**: Day-to-day urgencies tend to take precedence over opportunities to improve often go unnoticed or aren't acted on.
* **Who**: The team
* **When** At the end of the sprint, but 

User Stories
============
* **What**: A short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability.
* **Who**: Anyone, but it’s the customers responsibility to ensure a prioritised backlog exists.
* **When**: Usually a story writing workshop is held at the start of the project, but they can be created at any time.
- As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.
