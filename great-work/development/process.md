* **Who**: Developers and customers work together through the entire project and communicate daily.

The Team

* **Team**: Developers and designers work together to estimates stories, defines tasks and design, implement and test the software product.
* **Lead**: Coaches the team, ensures process is followed.

Sprint Meetings
===============
* **Planning**: Prioritisation, Select Goal, Task Breakdown
* **Stand-up/Scrum**: Daily, 15 minutes, quick status update. Not for problem solving 
* **Review**: what the team has delivered each sprint with the customer 
* **Retrospective**: Inspect and adapt each sprint. Also see Kaizen 

Sprint Planning
===============
* **What**: Set the goal for the sprint. Break down into user stories and tasks that can be completed within the sprint.
* **Why**: Planning helps with predictability of delivery
* **Who**: only the team
* **When**: Before each sprint begins

Daily Stand Up
==============
* **What**: As a minimum, each team member answers three questions:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Is anything slowing you down?
* **Why**: communication with your peers, not for reporting status to management
* **Who**: Anyone can attend, but only those actually on the team answer those questions.
