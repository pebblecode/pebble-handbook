# Creating Content Worth Sharing

There is a lot of content online, and because of that, many writers are competing in an attention poor environment. While that is not to say this applies to everyone, it is good to set expectations with our readers early on and give them signs that suggest your article is worth taking the time and effort to review.

For the tl:dr generation:
If you want to create content worth sharing, start with content worth reading. Here are few things we can do for people who scan first and read later (i.e. get a feel for what benefit your piece will give the reader.)

# Title
Depends on who your target audience is. It should create enough curiosity that makes people want to click on it.

# Intro, Structure, Take Away
Though this might not be true for all, for people who scan an article to see if this is something worth reading, I tend to look at the following:

## First paragraph
The introduction should set the context for why I should read this piece - People want to know what they will get out of this.

## Visuals
Depending on the content piece, if you are talking about something technical that might need some internal visualising, it would help your reader to quickly see what you are talking about when readers are scanning through your piece.

## Structure
Subject headers in a blog piece can quickly give an idea to readers the direction your piece and give a sense for whether your content will likely give the reader what they are looking for.

## Last paragraph 
The Take away or conclusion, the best piece allows people to use your information and act on it.
