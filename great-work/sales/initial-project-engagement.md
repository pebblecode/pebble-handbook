# Kicking off

## 1. Introductions

### Introduce everyone in the room.

### Introduce pebble:

Our team help enterprise innovate like a startup. By understanding both business and user levers, we design and build digital experiences that solve the right problem. We love to do this through hacks, rapid prototyping and and iterative approach to delivery, which we’ll discuss more later. 



## 2. How we work 

### Our Process

We adapt our process based on the specific requirements of your project, but here are a number of methods we often include to deliver a great product.

* Workshops - Understanding the problem to be solved
* User Research - Understanding the end user
* Product maps - Mapping the ideal system architecture
* Content Definition - What the system is going to contain
* Wireframing - Initial layours and user flow
* Mock-ups - Defining the visual style
* System Build - Writing the code
* Releases - Output working software that can be tested
* Iteration - Build upon and improve the system
* User Testing - Gaining genuine user feedback
* Measurement - Quantifying the value of the product


### Sprints

We divide the process into a number of sprints, based on the size of the task


### Sprints - Planning

This takes place at the start of each sprint. The aim is to estimate what user stories you will accomplish during the sprint. Stories are assigned to individuals responsible for completion.

The Product Owner is responsible for keeping the backlog up to date, and prioritising their wish list for each sprint before each planning session. As the project develops, they can add or remove stories as necessary.

The team will then agree what can be addressed in the current sprint during planning. With daily grooming, everyone can quickly view the sprints progress.


### Sprints - Day to day

During the sprint (usually a 2 week period), we have short, regular catch-ups with the team. We do this where possible through video conferencing. The purpose is to outline the work completed on the previous day, and the plan for today. They could be as short as 5-10 minutes, or take longer as deemed necessary.


### Sprints - Review & Retrospective

As each sprint ends, we finish with a review & a retrospective. The review is a chance to demo any work completed. Any unfinished stories can roll over in to the next sprint.

The restrospective offers an opportunity to generate insight on both the positive and negative aspects of a spring. For example, if stories weren’t completed, what held them up? By creating actionable improvements we can work more productively in the next sprint.   




## 3. Understanding the problem

### Understanding the users

First off, we need to understand the people involved in this process. We do this to create a common understanding of the final user. This will allow us to create a product that is user oriented, allowing them to reach their goals through the best possible experience.

**Task:**
Put yourself in their shoes and try to describe what each would be hearing, seeing, saying, doing, thinking and feeling.


### Drawing the problem

Now we need to draw out the current problem.  We often try to describe what we're imagining, but a diagram often gets us to a common ground quicker, allowing better discussion. This will either confirm our beliefs, or highlight areas of dispute.

**Task:**
Sketch out the existing problem or process flow as a diagram. Where is each users involved, what are the key decision points and why are these steps necessary?


### Defining requirements

Now we have mapped out the problem, we should try and pin down the key features that each user will require from this system. This will create the basis for our backlog.

**Task:**
Using one post-it per story, write out the features the system needs from each users point of view. Try to write in the format *As [someone], I want [something] for [some reason].*


### Technology requirements

## 4. Defining the Goal

### Setting the Goal

In 1960’s NASA had a goal of placing a man on the moon and bringing them back safely, within the next decade. Every worker, from the engineers to the cleaning staff would understand that this was the reason they came to work every morning.

If we can create a single sentance goal for this project, each team member can easily understand the path the project needs to take.

**Task:**
Try to define the overarching goal of this project in as few words as possible.
