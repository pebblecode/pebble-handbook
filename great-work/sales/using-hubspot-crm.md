# Using Hubspot CRM & Sidekick

Rule! The better the data, the better the experience. 

* Ensure that for all your contacts, that they have as many contact details as possible. 
* Add notes and reseaerch to the CRM (fine to link a Google Doc if applicable).
* Track ALL email correspondence with leads in the CRM (the Sidkick Chrome extension enables this).
* Track calls too. 
* Add tasks and deals. 
* Set contact type (i.e. lead, customer, sales qualified, subscriber, etc)

Some of these things will take some time - please shout if too much as we can find a way of supporting. 

Any questions, please talk to Toby/Paul.
