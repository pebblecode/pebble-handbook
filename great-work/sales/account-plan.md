# Account Planning

Periodically it is good to do an acount plan. This can generate business, increase engagement from the team and augment pebble's ability to understand a client.

The technique for this is three stages

# What we've done

This should cover

* High level themes from the work (e.g. digital by default, mobile, agile capability)
* Projects
* Prototypes

# Where are they

This should cover 

* Industry drivers
* Their current situation
* Their competition
* How financial markets perceive them

It should be a high level understanding that would be similar to a CEO view 


# The plan

This is pebble's response to 'Where are they'. We should think about how we can solve their major problems and opportunities. There may be several high level themes and it makes sense to draw these on a wall and prioritise which ones are most interesting to pebble and speak best to our capabilities.
