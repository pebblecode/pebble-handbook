# Sweating Sales 

There will be times when a sales forecast doesn't look attainable. Fear not! There are a number of techniques to use. 

## Close the forecast

First focus on what you've already got in the forecast. It is in there for a reason so unless things have changed you should be able to close it. Getting these sales in should be the lowest effort and the easiest way to bring the numbers up.

## Work your client base

Ring round your client base and let them know that you have some spare cycles and could they use them on any of their projects? Start with current projects and then fan out to recent projects. Use price flexibility in relation to the urgency of hitting a target. 

## New prospects

This has the lowest chance of success so should be considered last. Cold calling is unlikely to yield sales so other techniques should be explored. A seminar on an interesting topic and inviting peers into the room might be one way to generate business. For example 'Best Practices for Enterprise Agile'. 
Of interest to the attendees would be to network with their peers so keeping pebble's talk short and facilitating a discussion is better
