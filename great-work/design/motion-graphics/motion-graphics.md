#Motion Graphics Workflow

##Introduction

On occasions where we need to provide information in an engaging way, we often use animation and video.
This has often involved longer pieces such as videos for education, marketing, or documentation, but occasionally takes the form of animated GIFs, sprites, or CSS animation.

##Tools
We use a variety of tools depending on requirements, ability.
Where possible, we stay within the adobe ecosystem for interoperability.
The majority of our instructional motion graphics pieces are done by animating layered *Illustrator* files in *After Effects*, but occasional other work has been done in *Blender* or something like *Processing*.
Our video pieces are usually done in *Premiere Pro*, with retouching and compositing in *After Effects*.
If *GIFs* are required, these are produced from videos in *Photoshop*.
Final Encoding is usually done in *ffmpeg*.

##Process

The process so far has consisted of 5 stages:

1. Agree a script with the client
2. Agree a style and rough approach to the video
3. Produce the first draft
4. Iterate on the draft based on feedback
5. When final video is approved, render out required versions

#1. Agree Script
The first step is to agree a script with the client. This can come either from us or from them, and if possible as output from a workshop where stakeholders have input. The actual wording of the script may change at a later date, but it's important to come to an agreement as far as the video's intentions and a rough structure of how these will be acheived.

#2. Agree Visual Style
The next step is to get sign-off on a rough visual style. This could be done via static mock-ups, an inital storyboard, or even very quick animation tests depending on the complexity of the script. Refer to previous examples where possible, and be careful to keep your ideas within the scope, ability, and budget of the project. (Pixar-style CG is probably unlikely!)

#3. Produce First Draft
Once you've agreed what you want to say and how you want to say it, it's time to move on to an initial draft. When doing this, it's important to have at least a few portions that are an accurate depiction of the final result. Both to wow and encourage the client, but also to give yourself a better idea of what's involved in producing the full video. Watch the whole piece through a few times to make sure that the pacing and any narrative makes sense and moves at the right speed.

#4. Iterate on the Draft
Based on feedback from the first draft, refine and edit the video till it achieves the stated aims in a way that is engaging and holds attention.
At this stage, it's helpful to keep rendering out versions, whatever the quality, to watch through (It's far easier to comment on a render than it is in after effects). Check there's no jarring motion or jump cuts in the video. In most cases, smooth animation takes priority to avoid disrupting the viewer's concentration.
As with any feedback, be aware of the time involved in amends and try and communicate that clearly.
With video, clients are not always aware of the scope of amends, and it's important to prioritise the whole piece over specific sections.

#5. Render final versions
When everything has been signed-off, render the files out to required delivery format - usually 1080p mp4, but occasionally other web formats for smaller filesizes.
FFmpeg is good for videos
Photoshop for animated gifs
imagemagick for sprites.
