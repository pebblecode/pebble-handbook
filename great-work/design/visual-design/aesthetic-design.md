# Aesthetic Design 

## Introduction
Aesthetic Design encompasses the visual element of all the work we do. This could be the UI of an application, the visual style of the a piece of motion graphics, or the illustrations in a HTML email. 
 
Our clients expect products that are not just useful but also beautiful. To this end we strive to create products that show thought and care in their Aesthetic Design. 

At pebble Aesthetic Design is never an afterthought. Similarly Aesthetic Design is never the driving force for a product. We should always strive to maintain a blanch between Aesthetic Design, UX design, and development. 

## What does good look like?
Aesthetic Design can often be seen as subjective, as experts we need to evaluate Aesthetic Design from an objective standpoint. We will also endeavour to educate our clients on what makes a piece of Aesthetic Design successful. 

To this end here are some areas you can look at to evaluate a piece of Aesthetic Design.

#### Effective
Does the Aesthetic Design serve the purpose of the product? To answer this questions you will need to throughly understand what the product does and who it is aimed at.

Whilst a rainbow inspired design maybe perfect for a line of childrenâ€™s toys it would be inappropriate for a finical trading platform. 

#### Clear
Is it easy to find all the information you are looking for? Are actionable items styled distinctly? Great Aesthetic Design should be transparent, all elements should be easily distinguishable and understandable quickly. 

#### Precise
All of our Design output should show attention to detail. Misaligned text, unequal spacing, or any other inconstancies can severely effect the perception of a products quality. 

These ideas and more are covered in [Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design) this is a great starting point for evaluation any design. 

## Tools
* **Analog** Most of the time it is advisable to start the design process with analog tools such as sketching or white-boarding. 

Sketching allows you to iterate over many different ideas as fast as possible before moving into software/code. White-boarding can also be used when a more collaborative approach is needed. 
* **Software** Once a design has been worked out with analog tools   you will often want to explore design within software. Currently the main tools for Aesthetic Design at pebble are [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Adobe CC](http://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html). 

Design software allows us to create easily create precise, beautiful designs however we should always be aware of how these designs will be created in code. 
* **Code** As well as implementing our Aesthetic Design in code for production products we will also often use code to experiment with Aesthetic Design.

This is most useful when we want to quickly mock up design solutions with an existing product, or when we want to test Aesthetic Designs which feature interactive elements. However working with code can often be slower than analog or design software so it may not be a good fit for the earlier parts of the process.
