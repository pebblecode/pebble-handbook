#Requirements Gathering Workshops

##The aim

As part of the software development process, it helpful to get everyone in the same room. At pebble {code}, we use requirements gathering workshops as a tool to improve the quality of work. The aim of requirements gathering workshops are:

1. Establish a solid rapport with the client through face-to-face interaction.
2. Formalise the formation of a team which includes people from both the client and pebble {code}.
3. Explore the vision of the client, and make sure all client stakeholders agree on the vision.
4. Stress-test the ideas of the client.
5. Establish what is not known, and needs to be determined through research.
6. Plan research.
7. Explore ideas.
8. Get people excited.
9. Make people envious that they weren't there. 

These aims are explored in more detail below.

##Preparing the workshop
A good workshop takes a certain amount of preparation. You should design the workshop with timings in mind. Make a large-sized schedule which will go on the wall. You should make it clear that you are going to stick to it rigorously. Be conservative about how many activities you can fit in to a workshop. Often people will be late, or will take longer breaks than you asked for. Make sure the workshop has a sensible flow to it. 

If the workshop is at pebble's offices, you should make sure that refreshments have been considered. You can make life much easier for yourself if you make sure that people are never hungry or thirsty. Sugary things tend to make people less fractious. For example, one workshop was rated poorly by the participants, and on inquiry it turned out that the croissants were stale. Everything else about it was fine. This may sound ridiculous, but it is very important to give clients an optimal experience.

Make sure that the whiteboards are properly clean. This may require using kitchen towels and cleaning spray. It is not acceptable to have smeary boards.

Make sure that there are enough pens. Make sure that none of them are faint or dry. If you are also using paper, make sure that the erasable pens are kept away from sharpies. Have plenty of post-it notes in a variety of colours. 

Print out an individual schedule for each participant. Give them each a water glass, and fill up the water jug. 

##1. Solid Rapport
Any workshop should start off with introductions. This involves going around the table and having people make a short statement about their position, what they've done in the past, and what their role in the project will be. 

It is often useful to have participants in the workshop state what they would like to get out of the workshop. If you do this, you should make sure that you check whether they got what they wanted at the end of the workshop. 

Often different stakeholders will have different agendas in a workshop. It is important to be able to read situations like this. We need to ride above the internal politics of a client, and avoid becoming involved or taking sides. There may be some stakeholders who are reluctant attendees. If you recognise that this is the case, work extra hard to make them feel included. 

##2. Team Creation
At pebble, we work closely with client teams. We do not have a client services layer. It is important to establish up front that the people who attend these workshops are the people that the client will be working with. With agile work, we need to be in daily contact with our clients, and this should be reinforced within the workshop.

##3. The Vision
The vision is always, to some extent, wrong. The art to making sure that the client does not settle on anything sub-optimal or mis-conceived is to gently show them the route to a better solution. If you can make them think that it was their idea in the first place, then that is the way to go. 

It is frequently the case that the client has never drawn out what the new system actually looks like. They will have had plenty of conversations, but until the idea is on a whiteboard or a piece of paper, you can never be sure if everyone is talking about the same thing. 

As a result of this, it is often very useful to draw out the idea, in full on a whiteboard. This has a number of effects. Very often the idea will be too complicated. This will become immediately apparent if you draw it out. If things do not connect well (for example between users), this will also be obvious. 

Remember to keep on stepping backwards from the solution. You will have conversations which will include talk of databases, websites, apps and platforms. Remember that for all software projects, there is a *Job to be Done*. Focus on that job to the exclusion of any solution. If the problem can be solved with some tape and bits of string, then do that. 

One of the recurring themes of Visions is for clients to request something that is either Excel or PowerPoint, but with an extra feature. It is important to continually work to pare back these unreasonable requirements until you are left with the core vital functionality. 

##4. Test the idea
This is linked to the vision. You can use games to explore how the idea will work from different viewpoints. How is this going to work for user type x or y? Have we forgotten that some people use screen readers? What about those without smart phones? It is very easy for people in the IT and software industry to enter an echochamber where we assume that everyone is like us. 

##5. What don't we know?
Clients will frequently make assumptions about their users for which they have very little or no evidence. It is our responsibility to challenge their assumptions. How do you know that they need this or that feature? Where did you get this information? There will be natural limits to how much we know. Then there will be things that we think we know but are incorrect about. It is the job of pebble {code} attendees to convince the client that if they truly want to service the needs of their users, they will need to conduct a certain amount of upfront research. 

##6. Plan Research
If the client agrees to conduct research, we need to create a plan. Who do we need to speak to? What are their profiles? How can we get hold of them? What are the timescales?

##7. Explore Ideas
A really successful workshop will have a considerable component of ideation. We need to make sure this ideation is structured, and not just a freeform brainstorm.

We have plenty of examples of techniques that are good for ideation. One in particular is iterative drawing. Participants are asked to repeatedly draw the idea, focusing in turn on one aspect or another. This is useful in helping participants to consider ideas from different perspectives. 

##8. Get People Excited
A really successful software project needs to inspire people. The workshop can play the role of providing this excitement. We should always be considering ways to improve this experience and increase levels of excitement. 

##9. Envy
Our ultimate aspiration for pebble {code} workshops is to make people really want to attend. We should be known for excellent workshops, and should promote this.
