# Hack Day Preparation
At the moment Hack days are run quarterly and usually held on the last Friday of the month. When setting a date, be careful that the date is not next to a Bank Holiday.

For the Hack Day projects, we will set a theme for the event, but they are not required to follow the theme if they have something else they want to work on.

When you announce the event, be sure to remind the folks leading projects to update their clients so that critical deliverables don't fall on that date.

#Scheduled Hack Day
- Sept: 3rd (date was pushed later because of Bank Holiday)
- Dec: End of the month - May want to have an early one in January instead
- Mar: End of the month

## Before the event:
Share resources: Create a Google doc with links to inspirations and to stuff on the web that might be useful and encourage everyone to add anything you might find useful. 

Example of a resource doc: [Audio Hack Day](https://docs.google.com/a/pebblecode.com/document/d/1TUnmFfBAfaLXbZ4zMUneK5OyO-VYVzMl9dJ_E7lJk6g/edit?usp=sharing)

Send a reminder the the team 1 week out

Confirm Numbers* and order breakfast / lunch / pizza and beer

\* Don’t forget to ask the folks in IT if they want to be included and also check who from the Bede Development team will be in on the day.

## In the morning - Facilitating the event

Introduce the theme of the event and ask everyone in the room what projects to give a small introduction to what they want to work on. Help people to form teams - if required.

## During the day - Document the day

Create a document for the teams to add some details about the projects they have been working on. We can use this later on to create blog post:

## In the afternoon - Demos

We have a projector in the reception area so it would be cool to get everyone presenting on the big screen if they can. If it’s tricky, go around everyone’s desks. Demos are nice and short, usually 4 to 5 minutes long.

Using the big white board wall next to the kitchen, give a recap of the teams and the projects that they are working on. List the Projects on the wall and carry out voting. Everyone gets 2 votes.  - Don’t vote for yourself and 1 vote per project
