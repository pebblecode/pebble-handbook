# Strategy

**"Building software that lasts, and is loved"**

**Mission**

Our mission is to create a globally recognised software development company, known for its success, people, policies and products. 

**Core Values**

Our core values, that lie at the heart of everything we create, are:

- To be the best at what we do - for every decision we need to ask ourselves if the route helps us achieve the best or takes us away from that.
- Expectation management, coding standards, testing standards, deployment standards. 
- Grow great people - they are our most important asset. 

**Objectives**

Our main objectives are to continue to grow a great team, have a great place to work, produce outstanding software and make a profit doing so. _(Detailed objectives to be agreed and shared shortly). _
